            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>CHriſtian Reader, you haue heere before your eyes, ſome labours of that faithfull ſeruaunt of Chriſt, Ma. <hi>George Estey.</hi> Such as haue knowne him (if the feare of God be within their breaſts) will both bewaile his immature death, and alſo take in good worth, euen theſe fruits of his happy life. Wee may graunt with griefe, that if the Author had longer liued, theſe works might deſerue to haue beene the better loued, and if hee had publiſhed, they muſt needs haue been thoroughly poliſhed: Neuertheleſſe, let vs rather thankfully make vſe of what Gods mercy hath left, then diſcontentedly remember what Gods anger hath denyed. There is no cauſe why thou ſhouldeſt blame my poore endeauour, ſeeing there hath not beene wanting on my part, either the iudgement of graue men to counſell me, or the importunitie of friends to call vpon me, or mine own fidelitie to diſcharge mee, for and in the imparting of theſe things vnto thee. Neither will there be cauſe (I truſt) to blame the workes, ſo be it there be not wanting on thy part iudgement, wiſedome, and patience, ſoundly to weigh all things, wiſely to interpret ſome things, ſlightly, or with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle meditation to read nothing. And ſo I am ſure, wee may finde in theſe pithy and conciſe writings, plentifull matter of ſinguler inſtruction. Somewhat hath beene heeretofore publiſhed by others, but with much deprauation in diuers places, and ſore againſt my will to whom the originall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies were committed: alſo in this impreſſion, ſomething is kept backe by authoritie, as namely the proofe of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors iudgement, touching Chriſtes diſcention into hell. Let me giue further notice, that the beginning of the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Goſpell vnto the 6 verſe of the 1 of Iohn, I was faine to ſupply out of the Authors notes in Latine, which
<pb facs="tcp:1866:3"/>he penned firſt, beeing wanting in the Engliſh copie of his ſecond penning. I thought this courſe very neceſsary, that ſeeing ſo good a work wanting an end, by reaſon of the too too ſoone end of the Authour (if it had pleaſed God) yet it might haue ſome beginning, as alſo that the method and order of that which followeth might be perceiued. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the beginning of the Creed mentioneth, is not to be vnderſtood of that which is ſet before it, but of the courſe in preaching. Finally, the Epiſtle dedicatorie of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors owne making, though priuatly ſent in his life time with a written copie, yet becauſe I found them together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his owne originall writings, and hauing permiſſion by will to publiſh theſe his works, I thought it meete not to ſuppreſſe ſo thankfull, ſo deſerued, and ſo elegant a dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And thus (Chriſtian Reader) I commend thee &amp; thy labour in theſe workes, vnto the bleſſing of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie.</p>

<note place="margin">Baſill.</note> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as indeede a wiſe and learned Father calleth it, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon treaſure-houſe of all good inſtructions.</p>
            <p>So as whoſoeuer ſhall not highly make account hereof, diſpleaſeth God, and hurteth himſelfe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:5"/>
            <p> Now though this booke be like a boxe of Pearles, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in none can diſpleaſe: yet for ſome purpoſes, one may be fitter then other: exerciſes of conſcience in the caſe of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning firſt vnto God, or quickening and increaſing that, are ſpecially to be followed. Such is this Pſalme, hauing more varietie of neceſſarie matter then any ſo ſmal Scripture that I knowe, beeing as a man may tearme it, a conſcience or practicall Catechiſme, ſo ſuting theſe times, and eſpecially Gods children in them, as that I would wiſh them when they meane to ſtirre the wheeles of all good graces in them, to vſe this Pſalme, as <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen</hi> did the Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to make him mourne.</p>
            <p>But it is beſt to heare the Pſalme ſpeake for it ſelfe, both in the inſcription and Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>The inſcription is, <hi>for</hi> or <hi>to the Maister of the Muſicke, a Pſalme of Dauid, when the Prophet Nathan came vnto him, after he had gone in to Bathſheba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And containeth in it fiue eſpeciall things; The partie to whom it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted; The kinde of Treatiſe; The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour; The time; The occaſion.</p>
            <p>The partie to whom it was committed, is in the Hebrew, <hi>Lamnatſeah,</hi> for the meaning whereof the learned doe not accord. Some expound it, him that excelleth or ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, to wit, in ſinging. Others, the Maiſter of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort quire or Muſicke, in ſuch a kind and courſe. What it is we may better vnderſtand by the 1, Chron, 15, 21. <hi>Matthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia, Eliphelet,</hi> and others, were ſet ouer the baſſe, &amp; tenor, for that is the <hi>Shemimth,</hi> that is the eights or diapaſon, as the Muſitians call it. Where by the way we may perceiue, that the godly learned Interpreters at Geneua, miſtooke that <hi>Lamnatſeah,</hi> as it is in the Hebrew, and haue in theyr tranſlation made it a proper name.</p>
            <p>Thus it was. The Muſicians by Dauid and Salomon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, were deuided, into companies and courſes, as may appeare, 1, Chron, 25, the cheefe of which companie vvas called as heere, hee that excelleth, that is, in that companie and kind of Muſicke, ſomwhat like the Chauntor or Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1866:5"/>of the children in Cathedrall Churches. Hence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that ſome pſalmes are to <hi>Ieduthim,</hi> to <hi>Corah,</hi> that is, committed to them.</p>
            <p>Now they were committed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to appoint the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke for the ſinging of them, a ſhadowe whereof is in the appointing of ſeruices in Cathedrall Churches. Looke 1, Chron, 16, 7. So as that they were committed to them for others, euen as Chriſt ſendeth to the Angels, Apocal, 2, 3, that is, the Paſtors, for the whole people and Church.</p>
            <p>So doe the Prophets prophecie againſt ſome Kings, and yet for the people to.</p>
            <p>All this was done as a part of the ſolemne worſhip of God, to continue.</p>
            <p>Whereupon we may learne, that the booke of pſalmes is ſcripture inſpired by God, conteyning inſtruction for the people of God. This may further appeare, by the pſalme for the Sabbath, which is 92, by the 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, pſalmes, which the Iewes call their <hi>Haleluiah,</hi> and vvere ſung at the Paſſeouer, and are that hymne or ſong which is mentioned in the Goſpell, and alſo by other moe. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that ſometime in the perſon of Dauid, Chriſt &amp; the Church are to be conſidered of vs.</p>
            <p>Further, ſuch pſalmes were committed to theſe Maſters of the Muſick, to require other to ſing them, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, Col, 3, 16, requireth that wee ſhould ſpeake vnto our ſelues, that is, amongſt our ſelues, one to another, in pſalms and hymnes, ſo as that it may be a great ſhame to vs, if not ſtaying all ribaldrie ſongs and vaine ſonets, we procure not the pſalmes euen of others to be ſung. Dauid would not els ſo oft haue made it his exerciſe, and prouoked other thereto. And for the better directing our ſinging, we muſt doe it with vnderſtanding, Pſalme 47, 8, that is, firſt, that our ſelues may vnderſtand, otherwiſe, we were as good to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ol fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> or ſound as inſtruments doe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if wee be with companie, others muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand vs, 1, Cor, 14, 15: And ſo muſt they vnderſtand vs, as that our ſinging may be with grace, as Col, 3, 16, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
<pb facs="tcp:1866:6"/>occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of profitable matter &amp; inſtruction in grace.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it muſt be done with the hart. Col, 3, 16, with feeling affections and cheerefulneſſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it muſt be to the Lord, that is, the hart lifted vp vnto God, and reſting in the ſound of Muſick, but hauing the minde ſet vpon the matter.</p>
            <p>Hence followeth, that euen in ſinging, it beeing to be performed to God, it ſhould be with great reuerence.</p>
            <p>But heere one may maruaile, that Dauid, ſuch a great man as he was, whoſe credite ought to be preſerued to him ſelfe, and his people, ſhould commit a pſalme to others to be ſung, wherein his owne faults ſhould be to all poſteritie proclaimed and blazoned. No doubt it is, firſt to teach vs, that euen the particuler examples of the Saints of GOD, haue vſe for common inſtruction, and now in this kind of Dauids fact, to learne ones owne infirmitie, howe diligent in ſearching ones owne ſelfe, howe ſeuere againſt himſelfe for faults, how deſirous to riſe after falls, euery one ſhould be.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that in ſome caſes a man may be acknown of his perſonall faults to others, and openly.</p>
            <p n="1">1 According as he hath offended publiquely, as Dauid did, or priuately.</p>
            <p n="2">2 When we be acknowne of our owne ſinnes &amp; Gods mercies, to comfort others, as Paule dooth of his perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p n="3">3 To witnes our ſound and thorough turning to God, while we are not loath to be acknowne of our faultes, in the face of the world.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the partie to whom this treaſure vvas committed of truſt, nowe foloweth the kinde of the endi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, it is ſaide to be a <hi>Pſalme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Pſalme</hi> is, when there is Muſicke ſet to a dittie: a ſong is (many times) muſicke or notes without dittie.</p>
            <p>Dauid was wont and others, to ſing to theyr Harpes or Lyraes, as we are wont to play two or three or foure parts, and ſing the ſift, thus did the Lyricke Poets, <hi>Pyndarus, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratius,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:1866:6"/>make ditties for ſuch muſick.</p>
            <p>But this is the difference, Dauids Muſicians had the gift of prophecying, as 1, Chro: 25, 1, 2, 3, that is, to open the Scriptures, and make godly ditties, for the vſe of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, and did not onely make noyſes in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Tabernacle. 1, Chron, 25, 5.</p>
            <p>The inſtruments and voyce were, when there had been before ſome ſermon of the prayſing of God, to ſtir vp the people thereunto. Looke pſalme 57, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Why then ſhould not wee by all the meanes that God affoordeth, ſtir vp our dull harts to praiſe him?</p>
            <p>Or ſhall Dauid haue ſuch priuate exerciſes of religion, as that he can pen mournfull ditties or Elegies, and ſhal not we likewiſe exerciſe our ſelues vnto godlineſſe? ſomtimes ſearching out our ſinnes &amp; bewayling them, gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the promiſes of God in Chriſt to beleeue in them, laboring to get particuler directions for euery of our prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, enrolling Gods fauours to vs, and returning prayſes for them.</p>
            <p>The Authour or ſcribe was <hi>Dauid,</hi> a King and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, bewayling his owne ſins, ſhewing vs: 1, That kings ſhould confeſſe theyr ſinnes, and ſet themſelues a part to take knowledge of them, and mourning ouer them.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That the breach of the worde of God, is a ſinne in kings, as well as any other, ſo that murther, adultery, though neuer ſo cloſe, ſwearing breaking the Sabbaoth, pride, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp;c, are ſinnes in them. What King either of Spaine or Fraunce, would haue doone as Dauid did? but yet ſo ought he.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And that if Dauid, who loued muſicke ſo well, did vſe it in ſuch an holy and profitable ſort, ought not wee to follow ſuch delights, as we may be the better for?</p>
            <p>The time was, <hi>when the Prophet Nathan had comne vnto him,</hi> and not before. That is, that then hee penned this Pſalme, not that he did not before acknowledge &amp; bewaile his ſin. For it is not likely, that a man as Dauid was, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods owne hart, could continue ſo long (as ſome
<pb facs="tcp:1866:7"/>thinke Dauid did) in his ſinnes, without touch of heart. Looke 2, Sam: 11, 27.</p>
            <p>Beſides; Dauids heart ſmit him preſently, in ſmaller matters, as for numbring of the people; wiſhing for water at the well of Bethlehem; cutting off the lap of Saules gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; &amp; therfore it is moſt probable it did ſo in this thing.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, vnleſſe Dauids hart had had ſome exerciſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it would hardly haue yeelded ſo preſently to Nathans reprehenſion: it was otherwiſe with Saul toward Samuel, with Adam and Eue to God.</p>
            <p>VVell then may ſome body ſay; if Dauid was touched in hart before, was it not ſufficient?</p>
            <p>Aunſw: No. God would haue the occaſion of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie giuen to the enemies by the death of Vriah, and the ſcandall to the people by the adultery of Bathſheba, taken away; and that Dauid ſhould be a patterne of effectuall conuerſion to all poſterities.</p>
            <p>Where marke, that when men openly and notoriouſlie ſin, God will haue it as openly acknowledged. Was not it thus in Manaſſes, Peter, Paule, and diuers others?</p>
            <p>This time is ſet out by circumlocution, to wit, that it was after that, <hi>Nathan came vnto him,</hi> that is, ſome months after his fault with Bathſheba, and vpon Vriah. According as likewiſe it falleth out with the children of God, ſundry times when they haue ſinned. Many yeeres there were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Manaſſes was touched, &amp; ſome months before Paule was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted after his perſecuting; the brethren of Ioſeph long after theyr vnkindneſſe to their brother, were grieued with themſelues. So that a man may be ſome while before he repent, and lie in ſome ſinne before he ſufficiently turne vnto God, and be in ſome way of turning, and yet not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie pleaſe God. Iehu did many good things, likewiſe the men that ſpied out the Land, ſaue Caleb and Ioſhua, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> neither did all as they ought. Then hath a man true &amp; full ſorrow for his ſin, when it is to conuerſion, and increaſing change.
<note place="margin">2, Cor, 7, 9, 11.</note> This the Apoſtle calleth <hi>godly,</hi> (other is <hi>worldly</hi>) ſorrow, and alwayes hath with it great care, great Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1866:7"/>indignation, feare, deſire, zeale, puniſhment, whereof we may ſpeake more particularly afterward.</p>
            <p>Nowe Nathan went to Dauid, as ſent of God, 2, Sam, 12, 1, not of himſelfe, nor ſent for by Dauid, or ſet on by any Courtiers or aduerſaries.
<note place="margin">1, Reg 22, 8. 2. Reg. 19.2 2, Sam, 7, 2,</note> Sometimes Kings could ſend for Prophets, Ichoſhaphat for Michaiah, Ezechiah to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah, and this our King and Prophet to Nathan: now Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than is faine to come without ſending for, &amp; goe by Gods commaundement onely, ſo are all mens mindes readier to finde fauours and comforts, then be acknown and confeſſe their ſinnes, not indifferently liking of the companie and miniſterie of Prophets, but for their owne turnes and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</p>
            <p>Heere may we well thinke, howe Nathan might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, going to ſuch a perſonage, in ſuch a time, on ſuch an arrand, as by and by we ſhall heare of: yet is he not, but goeth about Gods buſineſſe, euen to the diſpleaſing, as he might feare, of Kings and Princes. Why then ſhould anie be ſo nice, to feare rebukes &amp; taunts of meaner men, which draw no blood?</p>
            <p>And ſeeing that Dauid had need to be put in mind, who can iudge any admonition ſufficient for himſelfe?</p>
            <p>This comming of Nathan to Dauid, is to be conſidered of, by the intent and end to rebuke and conuince Dauid, as may appeare by Nathans whole courſe, and the ſucceſſe thereof.</p>
            <p>But marke, I beſeech you, Nathans iudgement and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, 2, Sam, 12, 2, darklie he goeth about the buſh, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to make Dauid confeſſe firſt in the generall, then to conuince him in the particuler, fearing that if hee had gone plainly to worke, the King would not haue heard all, but cut him off in the midſt; or if hee firſt had opened the fault, &amp; not conuinced the iudgement, it might haue coſt him the ſetting on.</p>
            <p>Can we but learne from hence, that indeede dangerous it is for outward eſtate, to aduertiſe Princes of their faults? and for all that, yet when God commaundeth, it muſt be
<pb facs="tcp:1866:8"/>done. Now God commaundeth all duties of ones place. Thus did Iohn Baptiſt, Elias, and others.</p>
            <p>Neither this onely, but very hard wil it be, to bring great ones to ſee their faultes, Saule may teach vs this. Theſe thinke not of ſinnes, they thinke their places excuſe them, and many ſuch fig-leaues haue they.</p>
            <p>Yet for all this, men muſt endeuour that ſuch may know and amend their faults, who ſin not alone, but by example infect others.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, Why was Nathan ſent, rather then ſome other?</p>
            <p>For his miniſterie and place, for gifts, and ſidelitie, as a knowne man meete to conuince the King.</p>
            <p>Where then are theſe Eliaſſes, Iohns, Latimers, &amp; ſuch like?</p>
            <p>Now marke the fruite, Dauid is rebuked and amendeth. So doth God bleſſe his owne ordinances, as to Saule, and Ahab, who ſomewhat yet by rebukes were reſtrained. Let none therefore make doubts in Gods buſineſſes, but go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, and leaue the ſucceſſe to him who giueth it.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Dauid is rebuked &amp; amendeth at a worde. Heere is a difference betweene the rebukings to the children of God, and men vneffectually called. Gods children are corrected and rebuked at and by the word: Gods workes are wont to worke more with worldlings.</p>
            <p n="2">2 But put caſe they hearing the word doe ſeare, as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod and Faelix, &amp;c, after they forget: Gods children doe hide it vp, and make it of vſe and to rebuke, long after that they once haue heard it.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Or graunt the worldlings doe thinke vppon it, they are not reformed: the godly are.</p>
            <p>The occaſion remaineth, which is both of Nathans meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and Dauids enduring this Pſalme, to wit, <hi>his going in to Bathſhela.</hi> Where firſt mark the words, after the matter. The words are verie graue, honeſt, and ſeemely, giuing vs to take knowledge of that which is not ſo comly to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. This phraſe is vſuall in the Scriptures, as <hi>Knowing.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1866:8"/>
            <p> It is a grace of ſpeech in ſeemely termes,
<note place="margin">Eyphemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos.</note> to deliuer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely things: ſo Iob, 1, 5, bleſſing is put for the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as 1, Kings, 21, 10. This is vſuall in the Scriptures, as likewiſe in other tongues, <hi>Eyonyma</hi> in Greeke, a good name for a thing of worſe worth: <hi>Eymenides</hi> for the Furies: the old Latines, for nothing, would ſay well; for no bodie, good ſucceſſe, and ſo other Nations: the Tuſcan Italians, call diſeaſes which they moſt loath, with more fauourable names, as the Falling ſickneſſe, Gods diſeaſe, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p n="1">1 How ought men therefore abſtaine from euil deedes, when the Spirit of GOD forbeareth euen the ordinary names of common ſinnes?</p>
            <p n="2">2 Nay a ſhame ſhall it be for vs, not to leaue of all filthie ſpeech, and not ſo much as to name with liking any ſinne. Looke Exod: 23, 13, Hoſea, 2, 17, Pſalm, 16, 4.</p>
            <p n="3">3 So that if euen for termes a man ſhould looke to him ſelfe, the like care is to be had of companie, recreations, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, diet, and ſuch things, wherein we may very ſoone of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.</p>
            <p>The matter &amp; meaning of the phraſe is, that Dauid ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Bathſheba, and by occaſion thereof vpon Vriah, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing likewiſe cauſe to the enemies to blaſpheme. 2. Sam, 12.</p>
            <p n="1">1 O then, into what fearefull ſinnes may the children of GOD fall? To any ſaue that which is againſt the holy Ghoſt; ſo that all the care in the world is too litle, to watch ouer our ſelues with.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Againe ſee, how one ſinne tolleth on another, Dauid little thought of murther at the firſt; but nowe to ſeeke a cloake for adulterie, he will commit that, yea not care for the glory of God in reſpect of his owne credit. Doubting in Eue bred diſobedience, and the miſerie of all mankind. Wherefore reſiſt ſinne in the beginning, it will too ſoone grow too ſtrong, and draw a long taile after it.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Beſides conſider that Dauid had (no doubt) of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie Chamber, whom hee vſed verie ſecretly for Bathſheba, as he dealt with Ioab for Vriah by priuate Letters, neither durſt thoſe parties be acknowne. Court ſinnes are manie
<pb facs="tcp:1866:9"/>times couert and cunning, and yet for all this, we ſee they come and breake out. It is therefore follie, ſinning to think to lie hid. <hi>Thou diddest it ſecretly</hi> (ſaith Nathan to Dauid, from the Lorde) <hi>but I will doe this</hi> (that is,
<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.12.</note> puniſh thee) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Iſraell, and this ſunne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay Kings themſelues cannot ſinne without marking by God, and in his time reuealing.</p>
            <p>Now the partie with whom this ſinne was committed, is not to be neglected. Bathſheba, a vvoman not onely of good houſe and place, whom Dauid the King after mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, but a deuout woman, obſeruing the religious ſeruices of God in her purification,
<note place="margin">2. Sam. 11.2.4.</note> verie wiſe and accompliſhed, as may appeare by the 31 of the Prouerbs, which ſeemeth to haue beene of her making, &amp; yet ſhe is ouer-taken to folly.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Let good Ladies then take heede of daliance &amp; cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Sooner may they be ouercome then they thinke for: ſuch is the poyſon of euill companie and ſpeech, able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the chaſteſt in the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And if Dauid and Bathſheba commit follie, may we doubt but that there was a great deale more filthines then, in the Court? So it is, ſome one ſin appearing, may make vs iudge of many cloſe. Reade ouer the whole eight chapter of the prophecie of Ezechiell. Where then many ſinnes breake out, know that many more are committed, vvhich ſhould make vs mourne at the filthineſſe of ſuch times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But one may ſay, I neuer committed adulterie; I neuer kept whore. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aun.</hi> There is no Dauid for all that, that hath not his Bathſheba, no Bathſheba that hath not her Dauid; that is, none is there, but taketh delight in ſome ſin or other. Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie is whoredome, ſo is couetouſnes. Iam, 4.4.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, let euerie one ſeeke to finde out the ſtrange fleſh his ſoule runneth after as his Bathſheba, which one may doe by applying the whole word of God to his whole ſelfe, conſtantly ſtudying and meditating thereupon, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more account of the witneſſe of our conſciences, then the iudgements of any other.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1866:9"/>
            <p> That ſhall we finde to be our Bathſheba or ſweet ſinne,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Which we will leaſt be acknown of, as in Saule for the Amalekites, Herod for Herodias, and ſuch like. So doe proude, couetous, &amp; riotous perſons, excuſe, extenuate, or cloke their ſinnes.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Which though we take great heede, we ſhall eaſily of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in, as that of the tongue, Pſalm, 39, 23, Iam: 3, 8, So is it for anger in parties ſubiect thereto.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Which enemies waite to trap vs moſt in, and can vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braide vs moſt with. They can ſooner ſee it, then wee our ſelues. Nature in euery body ſootheth it ſelfe, &amp; none but thinketh himſelfe faire, &amp; his own breath ſweet. But eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if thoſe whom wee iudge aduerſaries are godly and wiſe, as Elias to Ahab, &amp; Michaiah, Iohn to Herod, there will be no error.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Beſides, in griefes of conſcience, that woundeth ſoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, which is from the ſweeteſt and moſt vſuall ſin.</p>
            <p>And after this once found out, let him be humbled to conuerſion for it. Which neuer will be till acknowledging all ſinne in generall, and miſliking our owne known ſinnes in ſpeciall, wee forſake them all. Neither let vs thinke that any ſinne is ſmall, and may be made light of.</p>
            <p n="1">1 What can be little that offendeth the infinite God?</p>
            <p n="2">2 That deſerueth euerlaſting death?</p>
            <p n="3">3 And if one ſinne of Adams, poiſoned (as I may ſay) the whole world, ſhall we nouriſh any?</p>
            <p n="4">4 Indeed, if but all the world could diſcharge a man but from one ſinne, it were ſomewhat.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Or that but one ſin not remitted, did not damne: but it is quite otherwiſe.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe. </seg>1</label> Now followeth the Pſalme it ſelfe, which all is a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and neceſſarie prayer, continually to be vſed for the matter of it, of all and euery the children of God.</p>
            <p>Whereof there are two parts. The firſt the generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb facs="tcp:1866:10"/>braideth his people with the want thereof. Ezech: 16, 4, 9, and Ieremie requireth it, Iere: 4, 14 to be had. The ſpeech likewiſe is borrowed from things ſoiled, which being wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed recouer theyr beautie: ſo the conſcience of man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing pardon of ſinnes, hath againe his former hue. Heere is mercie on Gods part, <hi>waſhing fault,</hi> on our part, <hi>iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Waſhing,</hi> to omit all bodily clenſing, may for this place be vnderſtood, either of the waſhing of ſanctification, as is Eſay, 1, 16, Prou, 30, 12, or of the waſhing of iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, as Chriſt ſpeaketh, Iohn 13, 8, 10, which I take indeede to be the Prophets mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, becauſe that it is the firſt waſhing neceſſarie: &amp; that the other is mentioned afterward. And heere by the way it will not be amiſſe to open Chriſtes meaning in that place.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore he ſheweth, that this waſhing is meerelie neceſſary to ſaluation; when as the blood of Chriſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, and applied by the hand of faith, clenſeth the conſcience.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt would haue Peter thus to be waſhed all ouer, head, hands &amp; feete: and not onely him, but as him, ſo all and euery other.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that as in the bathes they ſcoured downe the filth from theyr bodies to the feete, and then waſhed alſo and clenſed them, ſo wee had neede, that not onely groſſe ſinnes, but remnants thereof, ſhould more and more be purged away.</p>
            <p>So as that wee may learne from hence: 1 Not to thinke of our ſinnes as ſmall things, which the longer they cleaue vnto vs, we hauing meanes againſt them and yet doe not leaue them, will coſt vs more adoe ere wee can fully ſhake them off. Which as all the people of this our Land, ſo we of theſe places hereabouts had neede thinke of.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That as in waſhing, much rubbing &amp; wringing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, ſo we muſt know, that before we can ſhake off the filth of ſin, many rubbings &amp; wringings by afflictions muſt paſſe ouer our heads, &amp; that we ſhould vſe our afflictions
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1866:10"/>as ſope and lie, to ſcoure out the ſtaines of ſin thoroughly.</p>
            <p>Beſides, in that the Prophet thus wiſheth to be waſhed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 1 He ſheweth that we are not ſlightly blemiſhed with ſin, but that we are quite ſtained, and as it were branded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Looke Eſay 1, 18. Iere: 13, 2, 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And not onely ſo, but if hee might be thoroughly clenſed from ſinne, hee careth not what befell him, let him be rubbed, wringed, beaten, ſo ſinne may be driuen out, it is his deſire.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Withall he ſheweth, that he deſireth not only to haue ſin (as it were) ſhauen, but plucked vp by the rootes, and the ſpots taken away.</p>
            <p n="4">4 He feareth leaſt ſomewhat remaine vnforgiuen, and filth vnwaſhed out: heere is feare commendable. Philip: 2, 12.</p>
            <p n="5">5 And beeing once waſhed, will neuer foule himſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From my ſinnes. Sinnes,</hi> that is, iniquitie, any thing ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing from the rule of the word of God.</p>
            <p>So as that the godly: 1 Alwaies examine themſelues, and endeuour to fit themſelues to the word of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Finde many kind of faultes to accuſe themſelues of, as may heere appeare by the ſundry names of ſinnes, as alſo Pſalme 32, 1, 2, and the number vſed.</p>
            <p>The fourth ſpeech followeth, <hi>Clenſe mee from my ſin:</hi> in matter and meaning all one with the former. VVherein is likewiſe ſet downe the acknowledging of fault, &amp; crauing of pardon.</p>
            <p>Acknowledging of fault, as in the wordes <hi>my ſinne.</hi> The word in Hebrewe, is <hi>(Kata)</hi> which ſignifieth a miſſing of a marke one ſhoulde aime at. It is ſo properly vſed, Iudges the 20, 16. This marke is the word of God, Pſalm 119.15. They that put it in meeter thought of this. Now as he that hitteth not the marke, though he come neuer ſo neere, fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth of his aime: ſo booteth it not to come neer, if we touch not the word of God.</p>
            <p>Learne then: 1 That the worde of God, muſt alwaies be in our eye, well knowne and vnderſtood.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:11"/> 2 That all our deuiſes, delights, ſpeeches, and practiſes, muſt be directed heereto.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And that the leaſt ſwaruing from thence, much more wandring, rouing, is a ſin. So as that none can be too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>
            <p>Crauing pardon followeth, which hath in it, firſt a cloſe confeſſion of a more particuler fault, namely, vncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for in that the Prophet deſireth to be clenſed, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth ſpecially that hee is vncleane: then a crauing of cleaneneſſe.</p>
            <p>He ſeemeth in this manner of ſpeech to haue reſpect to the ceremonies of the Law, where ſundrie creatures liuing and without life, were counted vncleane, not ſo much in themſelues, as in regard of vſe to others.</p>
            <p>A ſinner then is vncleane, that is, ſuch as cannot well be vſed to any good ſeruice, while he continueth ſo.</p>
            <p>Firſt in regard that he diſpleaſeth God, whoſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement he hath broken.</p>
            <p>Secondly, euen by the witneſſe of his owne conſcience, as the Lepers, Leuit: 13, 45, ſo as that himſelfe can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with quiet conſcience. For as the Lepers, and other vncleane perſons, were not to meddle with any thing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they would pollute and defile it: ſo is it with ſinners.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by occaſion of ſcandall giuen, and ſo likewiſe making of others vncleane.</p>
            <p>As likewiſe fourthly all the godly, and ſome wicked can iudge.</p>
            <p>Note then that euery ſinner, that is, whoſoeuer willingly reſteth in ſin, is vncleane, euen his very conſcience, as Tit: 1, 15, ſo as that likewiſe all things to them becom vncleane: neyther can they goe about any thing with good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, while they abide in their ſinnes.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Shall not we then contemne vile perſons, Pſalm, 15, 4, fearing to be ſowred by their leauen? or ſhall wee haue fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the vnfruitfull workers of darkneſſe?</p>
            <p n="2">2 Or not our ſelues forbeare all ſinne? Seeing euery one dooth make vncleane, and anger defileth our ſeruice to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1866:11"/>God. Math. 5, 24.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Let not any ſinner looke to the ſhewe hee hath in the world, but to his cleaneneſſe before God, euen for his ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals toward men.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the confeſſion of vncleaneneſſe, nowe followeth the deſire to be clenſed, which God commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth as neceſſarie. Eſay, 52, 11, and Iere: 13, 27, is likewiſe promiſed in Ezechiel, 36, 21, hoped for by the Prophet. Pſalme 19, 13. So as that we ſhould not beare euen the leaſt ſpotte, no not in others, Iude 23, much more not in our ſelues, beeing all to be preſented without ſpot, and in the white ſhining robes of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now then, who ſeeth not himſelfe, to haue as much need as Dauid, or any? Wee euery of vs drinking in ſinne, &amp;c. vvherefore we ought as earneſtly to deſire it, as euer he did. But firſt we muſt know what it is, namely, the purging of ones conſcience from dead works, to ſerue the liuing God. Hebr. 9, 14.</p>
            <p>In which purging of conſcience, is witneſſe of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of fault and counting righteous, with abilitie &amp; cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in all things to ſerue GOD: without both vvhich the conſcience is vncleane.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ſprinkling of Chriſtes blood, Hebr, 9, 14, that is, the imputations on Gods part of Chriſtes ſufferings, and on our parts, the applying of them ſpecially vnto vs, as Ephe: 5, 25, 26. worketh this.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, one is ſaid to be cleane: 1 For the word, Iohn 15, 3. 2 By faith. Acts 15, 9. 3 By the Spirit renewing. 1, Cor: 6, 11. So as that if wee want any, wee vvant our cleaneneſſe.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the thing generally praied for, nowe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the partie to be conſidered, who is praied vnto, and that is, <hi>GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>O God,</hi> that is, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt. Father, from whom; Sonne, for whom; holy Ghoſt, by whom all good things doe come. Who onely can and will ſhew fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, &amp; forgiue ſinnes; otherwiſe then the Papiſts teach that
<pb facs="tcp:1866:12"/>and yet notwithſtanding for the preſent, God euerie time granteth it not. They muſt taſt of gall and wormewood.</p>
            <p>This is hard, but neceſſarie and profitable.</p>
            <p n="3">3 They feeling the ſweetneſſe of fauour, deſire it may be (as it is indeede) certaine. Fearing leaſt againe they ſhould leeſe it, which in no caſe they ſhall, 1 If they cleaue to God, as hee requireth in his word: 2 If euer they had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: 3 And deſire continually to keepe it.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the ſecond, the third is, <hi>According to the multitude of thy compaſsions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein is the

            </p>
            <p>The thing is <hi>compaſſions,</hi> motherly pittifulneſſes, for the word is taken from Mothers or dams toward their young ones, which can hardly be told, but by mothers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues.</p>
            <p>Now theſe are ſundrie and verie ſweet.</p>
            <p>It is verie hard to reckon vp the diuers kindneſſes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to wayward children, but much more of GOD to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſinners.</p>
            <p n="1">1 One is that ſome time or other, he will make them ſee and feele their ſinne and miſerie.</p>
            <p n="2">2 When they be throughly humbled, hee will not fullie nor finally forſake them.</p>
            <p n="3">3 He will watch ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo, as then, ere euer they think of it, he will draw them to conuerſion: as in Paule, Agu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, Luther. So as that euen their ſinnes ſhal turne to their good.</p>
            <p n="4">4 He neuer caſteth them away for their ſundry ſlips, and receiueth them whenſoeuer they returne.</p>
            <p>Now theſe are very, 1 Tender, euen as of a mother.</p>
            <p n="2">2 They are ſeaſonable.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Not alwaies to the will, but to the profit and good of the partie.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Theſe mercies are great. 1 Becauſe they are fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a great
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1866:12"/>God, to ſuch as we are, deſeruing the contrarie.</p>
            <p n="2">2 They laſt for euer. 3 They are in matters of verie great worth: to wit, ſaluation, as knowledge, faith, iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, peace, ioy, patience, worth all the world. 4 They are to take away ſin, which is great.</p>
            <p>Beſides, they are manie: firſt for number as before. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, For that they are renued.</p>
            <p n="1">1 See then, how hainous ſome one ſin or other is, that to the pardon thereof, wee haue neede of great and much mercie.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That hauing taſted the mercies of GOD, they who feele them, are neuer ſatisfied with them.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And that whoſoeuer once craueth mercie, muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſeeke to haue it renued as his ſinnes renue, or els it is not ſufficient.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt is <hi>much. Waſh me much.</hi> So as that a man of himſelfe, though he take Snow-water, and much Nitre, ſhall not of himſelfe be cleane. Chriſt therefore is like a purging fire, and like Fullers ſope, Mala. 3, 2. &amp; Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would haue his head &amp; hands, beſide his feete, waſhed. Ioh. 13, 9.

            <p>Now followeth the more ſpeciall ſetting down of things neceſſarie, either for the Prophet himſelfe, and thoſe from the beginning of the 3. verſe, to the end of the 19, or for the Church in generall, in the two laſt.</p>
            <p>For the Prophet himſelfe in particuler, and thoſe three. 1 Confeſſion of ſins. 2 Deſires or requeſts. 3 Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</p>
            <p>Confeſſion of ſinnes, from the beginning of the 3 verſe to the end of the 6.</p>
            <p>This confeſſion of ſin is of

                  <item>Actuall, in the part of the 3 and 4 verſes.</item>

            </p>
            <p>In the confeſſion, or acknowledging, there is, Firſt the act of confeſſion.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:13"/>
            <p> Secondly, the parties. 1 Confeſſing. 2 To whom the confeſſion is made.</p>
            <p>The act ſetteth downe the thing done, namelie, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the manner and the helping cauſe, to wit, <hi>the beeing of his ſinne before him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this act or practiſe is brought in as a reaſon, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Prophet to perſwade himſelfe, that this his prayer is heard, becauſe he doth not hide but acknowledge his faults, according to that, 1, Iohn, 1, 9.</p>
            <p>And is brought in, as though the Prophet deſired to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent a doubt, which thus might be made.</p>
            <p>Queſt. Why doe you ſo earneſtly pray for fauour and forgiueneſſe?</p>
            <p>Aun. I knowe my ſinnes better then any other dooth, how many and grieuous they are, I confeſſe them, this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me ſo earneſt.</p>
            <p>Teaching vs heereby, 1 The griefe and trouble of a broken ſpirit, Prou: 18, 14.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And that the greater the feeling of ſinne is, the more earneſt will the deſire of mercie be.</p>
            <p>But marke that the Prophet confeſſeth, and that firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he make any ſpeciall ſure.</p>
            <p>Confeſſion of ſinne is alwaies neceſſarie, by Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, it declareth that the partie is truly touched, as where there is ſmothering, one may doubt of feeling of ſin. It laieth open the ſore, that the plaiſter may be applied. The wicked alwaies conceale their faultes: the godlie are accuſers of themſelues, neither can they finde peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
            <p>The manner of this confeſſion followeth, ſet downe in the Engliſh word <hi>Know:</hi> not fully, for the moſt wicked &amp; vnrepentant knowe their ſinnes, and are neuer the better. Better were it therfore tranſlated, I make known to others, or acknowledge my ſinnes. VVell doe the Grammarians note, that in the Hebrew tongue, verbes of ſence (as <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is) doe ſignifie action alſo. Pſalme, 1. <hi>God knoweth the way of the righteous,</hi> that is, approueth, or ſheweth that hee
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1866:13"/>knoweth. So Luke 13, 25. <hi>I knowe you not,</hi> that is, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not you, and ſo is it heere. I acknowledge. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now this indeed is the property of the children of God, to make knowne their ſinnes, Dan: 9, Paule, Manaſſes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In this acknowledging there is:</p>
            <p n="1">1 Knowledge, 1 That is, perceiuing by the worde of God, that the thing founde fault with is a ſin, all doe not preſently yeelde heereto, as Saule. 2 That this ſinne doth deſerue euerlaſting damnation.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Application of the knowledge of the grieuouſneſſe of ſinnes to our owne ſelues, wherein eſpecially conſiſteth acknowledging. This is harder then the former. Better may one in generall know ſin, then that himſelfe in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer hath committed it, and yet this is neceſſarie. For this end are priuate meſſages to Dauid, Ahab, Herod, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Nowe this application, or acknowledging, muſt haue ſundrie properties.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It muſt proceede from the hatred of ſin. Take heede of confeſſing ſinnes in ieſting or boaſting: it is as in a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit caſting out things enemies to the ſtomacke.</p>
            <p n="2">2 With faith in the promiſes of mercie in Chriſt, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe deſpaire will aſſault.</p>
            <p n="3">3 From a ſetled iudgement, no light opinion, that our ſelues are ſinners.</p>
            <p n="4">4 According to the thinges wee are rebuked of by the Worde, as it was with Dauid toward Nathan, not taking exception againſt his charge.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Franke, not by compulſion, but of our owne accord.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Without excuſe, or leſſening our fault, nay rather with exaggerating.</p>
            <p n="7">7 VVithout delay, preſently.</p>
            <p n="8">8 VVithout opinion of deſert for acknowledging ſake. Thus much of the manner: nowe followeth the helping cauſe, which is the beeing of his ſin euer before him, this made him the rather to confeſſe, becauſe his ſinne was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies before the eyes of his minde &amp; conſcience, neyther could he find eaſe, till by confeſſion he had ſet them aſide.</p>

            <p>Sin is before one, 1 When one who hath ſinned, calleth his owne ſinne to minde, and of purpoſe ſearcheth his hart to that end, to humble himſelfe. 2 When the conſcience keepeth recorde againſt a mans will, and ſo checketh him. 3 VVhen God in mercie (the partie not thinking of it) v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſome meanes, as Nathan to Dauid, Elias to Ahab, to make them for euer after to thinke therof. All which I take it are meant heere.</p>
            <p>This <hi>euer,</hi> is with limitation from the committing of ſin, and taking true knowledge thereof in his owne hart, by meanes ſent of God.</p>
            <p>So as that no maruaile, if ſometimes Gods children haue not their ſinnes in their eyes. They muſt pray to haue their eyes opened.</p>
            <p>Let vs beſides conſider, 1 Howe neceſſarie this mercie of God is, to pricke our harts to true conuerſion, elſe ſhall wee not ſee our ſinnes.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The force of ſinne once knowne, it will neuer leaue checking the conſcience, till it be throughly taken away.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And that if we will be like the children of God, vvee muſt often call our ſinnes to minde, and exerciſe our ſelues thereabout, not ſeeke to forget them, or driue them out of our mind.</p>
            <p>Hetherto is the manner, the perſons follow, firſt confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. I Dauid, a King, who had done this matter ſecretlie that few knew of it, whom no mans lawe could make mee to doe as I doe, and might ſeeme to ſhame my ſelfe in that I doe, I, for all that, doe confeſſe my ſinnes.</p>
            <p>It is cleere then, 1 That Kings, and the greateſt in the world, ought to confeſſe their ſins. 2 Though they might without being detected conceale it. 3 And that the quiet of their conſcience, ſhould more be regarded, then all their honour and reputation, eſpecially in compariſon with the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1866:14"/>glorie of GOD.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, to whom confeſſion is made, &amp; that verſe 4. Now this perſon is God, not a Prieſt, to whom though, in ſome caſes we may confeſſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1 If we haue ſcandalized or wronged him.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If we endeuour to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort him, by reckning our faults<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Gods mercies.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Or if we deſire comfort from him.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Or deſire him to pray for vs.</p>
            <p>Not, 1 vvith conceit, that hee hath power to forgiue our ſinnes.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Or with iudging that we ought to be acknown of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie particuler.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Neither with opinion that heereby wee deſerue anic thing.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Or are willing to haue penance enioyed to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
            <p>To God confeſſion is to be made, 1 For the comaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement ſake, 2 Becauſe all ſinnes are moſt againſt him, 3 He taketh knowledge of all ſinnes, 4 Hee is able to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue them, 5 He promiſeth ſo to doe. 6 And he hath ſo done to Dauid. 2, Sam, 12, 13, and others.</p>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Repetition in theſe words, <hi>Against thee, thee onely,</hi> which manner of ſpeech bewrayeth an earneſt affection of the hart, as not beeing able to containe it ſelfe, great indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt himſelfe, ſo as that he ſeeth hee hath broken the Law of God, procured his diſpleaſure, and yet perſwaſion of fauour, otherwiſe he durſt not thus be acknowne.</p>
            <p>So as that all confeſſion ſhould be earneſt, and in faith, beſides the properties we had before.</p>
            <p>The ſingularitie of this partie followeth, in that it is ſaid, <hi>Against thee, thee onely,</hi> which all doe not expounde alike. Some <hi>against thee,</hi> who onely knoweſt what I haue done. Who
<pb facs="tcp:1866:15"/>ſinne is verie headlong, ſuddenly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoughts it wil come to outward act: 3 That none, but ſhould withſtand euen inward corruptions, Atheiſme, prophaneneſſe, vnbeleefe, hypocriſie, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the forme, <hi>In thine eyes, O God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God properly hath no eyes, but parts of the body are ſayd in the ſcripture to be in God, for their workes ſake. As be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the eye is an inſtrument of knowledge, therefore it is put for knowledge: ſo as that the Prophets meaning is, that God iudgeth this to be ſinne in whoſe eyes it is: God iudgeth that to be ſin, which is againſt his will written and reuealed.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Learne then, that all men ſin God looking on. Sin is in his eyes. 1 So as that all ſinners, ought to be afraid, when they ſinne. 2 The godly ought to be verie warie. 3 And to knowe, that as ſinnes committed, are in his eyes, ſo are good deedes, that the conſcience of his knowledge, ought to ſupport men in their good dealing, againſt all hard cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And that God is verie long ſuffering, who ſeeing ſo manie ſinnes, for all that ſpareth them.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And that Dauid co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering this, had wonderful griefe, which we well may examine, by 2, Cor: 7, 11, &amp; forward. Where are ſundrie workes of this godly griefe ſet downe. The firſt whereof is care, that is, mature and conuenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, to correct his fault, and to take away the ſcandall, to the which is thwart and contrarie, when a man not well vnderſtanding his ſinne, can confeſſe, but deferreth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, the Interpreters call cleering, in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall it is a ſpeech of defence for a mans ſelfe, whereby one may be iuſtly excuſed. Now this is when a man confeſſeth his fault, craueth forgiueneſſe, applieth Chriſtes merits, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth heede of the like ſin euer after: otherwiſe then when in worldly matters, men denie or leſſen their ſinnes.</p>
            <p>The third is indignation, to wit, a practiſe of holie anger againſt our ſelues, wherby we often blame our ſelues, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1866:15"/>euen hate our ſelues, and iudge our ſelues worthie of any puniſhment: heereuppon, all that we doe, diſpleaſeth our ſelues.</p>
            <p>The fourth is feare, which is a ſtirring of the conſcience, wherby we forecaſt all worſt things vnto our ſelues, doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting leaſt God ſhould not giue vs repentance and forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and thinking that mens, and Gods anger, might breake out vpon vs.</p>
            <p>The fift is great deſire, that is, a longing to ſatisfie Paul and all other, who might any way take knowledge of their ſin, with deſire to be reſtored to their fauours and likings.</p>
            <p>The ſixt is zeale, a moſt earneſt affection of the ſoule, which cannot be kept in, but breaketh thorough all, and will bewray it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>The laſt is reuenge, a voluntarie practiſe of all duties to keepe the bodie vnder, and preuent all like occaſions for afterward.</p>
            <p>Thus much of repeating his fault, nowe followeth his iudging of himſelfe, worthy of any puniſhment: and that is, by reckoning vp, wherein God might correct him by word or deede. For word, <hi>That thou mightest be iustified in thy ſayings.</hi> For deede, <hi>and pure when thou iudgest.</hi> That is, though thou ſpeake neuer ſo ſharply, or deale neuer ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely, yet all is iuſt; eyther in rebuking me by Nathan, or taking away the child by death, or whatſoeuer els.</p>
            <p>But the words and phraſe muſt be opened firſt.</p>
            <p>This ſmall worde <hi>(that)</hi> is ſometimes for end or intent, ſometimes for conſequent and euent, as in this place. For Dauid did not ſin to that intent, that hee might make God to be or to appeare iuſt: but when hee had ſinned, then whatſoeuer hee ſhould doe or ſay to Dauid, were iuſt and deſerued.</p>
            <p>But heere is a doubt. One would thinke that Paul in the 3 to the Romans and the fourth verſe, doth otherwiſe read and apply this place, then ſeemeth to haue beene Dauids meaning. Looke the place.</p>
            <p>Aun. Indeede he alledgeth the place according to the
<pb facs="tcp:1866:16"/>tranſlation of the Seauentie-two Interpreters, which then was moſt commonly vſed in the Church; which though it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad ſome differing ſound in words from the Hebrew, yet the ſence not much varying, he thought good to vſe.</p>
            <p>But for the application of it, Paule ſeemeth to me to doe that which our Sauiour Chriſt in a like caſe doth, Math, 4, 10. where our Sauiour ſeemeth to inſert the worde <hi>(onely)</hi> according to the intent of GOD, though it be not in the Hebrew, ſo that which the Prophet Dauid ſpeaketh of God for his owne perſon, Paule maketh a generall, that ſo it is in all parties, that God will be iuſtified, and ouercome. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Others interprete it otherwiſe, as though the Prophet ſhould vnderſtand this word I confeſſe, and then ſhould follow, <hi>that thou maiest be iustified,</hi> that I muſt needes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>thou art iust, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I take it that the Prophet hath regard to the ſecond of Sam: 12 chap: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, &amp;c. where God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing threatened and taken away the child, yet Dauid for all this confeſſeth God to be iuſt, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Well then, in that Dauid thinketh thus of himſelfe, no doubt but he acknowledgeth, he ought to be patient what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhould fall vpon him, ſo muſt euery child of God doe.</p>
            <p>But returne wee backe to conſider of Dauids caſting downe himſelfe, and ſubmitting to the iuſtice of God, in words, and in deedes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That thou mightest be iustified when thou ſpeakest:</hi> but firſt open the words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iustified,</hi> (not to reckon vp the ſundry meanings of it in diuers places of Scripture) dooth heere ſignifie, that thou oughteſt to be counted &amp; iudged righteous, ſpeaking not falſely, neuer too ſharply or hardly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When thou ſpeakest,</hi> or, in thy ſpeech, declaring no limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of time and place, whenſoeuer thou ſpeakeſt, that is, at all times.</p>
            <p>Speech heere (I take) is put for fault-finding, or reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1866:16"/>as by Nathan. The meaning is, whatſoeuer thy words are, yet notwithſtanding, euen by and in them, thou ſhalt be found and iudged iuſt.</p>
            <p>It may appeare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by this, 1 That as Dauid was ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie rebuked from God by Nathan, ſo ſundry times are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the children of God, as Peter by Paule, &amp;c, and this muſt they looke for, if not perſonally by worde, yet in the open miniſterie, or in their priuate conſciences. So are the Phariſes called Vipers, the Galathians fooliſh, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Dauid would ſhew, that his iudgement did differ from the multitude, who thinke that God is ſomtime too ſharp, for indeede ſo doe they, as Caine, and Iob in his impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Take heede then, while we fret and charge God foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhlie in our hart, we be not of the humour of the world.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In that, that Dauid ſpeaketh this by occaſion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, he ſheweth, that Miniſters ſpeeches and rebukes, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of Gods word, are from God himſelfe.</p>
            <p>And therefore ſhould be, 1 Patiently heard. 2 Taken to hart. 3 Made vſe of for life.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That whatſoeuer the world or our fleſh would moue vs vnto, alwayes ſhould wee acknowledge God to be iuſt and vpright.</p>
            <p>Now foloweth Dauids ſubmitting to the iuſtice of Gods deedes, <hi>and pure when thou iudgest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if he ſhould ſay, whatſoeuer thou ſhouldeſt doe vnto me, yet muſt I acknowledge thee iuſt, and vpright, much more in that thou wilt not let the adulterous birth to liue. For God being infinite, might inflict infinite puniſhment, but beeing good and iuſt, can doe nothing but that which is moſt good and excellent.</p>
            <p>All that Dauid ſaith, is in this ſpeech, <hi>When thou iudgest thou art pure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein are 2. things aſcribed to God,

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iudgement</hi> is taken two wayes, 1 Properly, for giuing ſentence in a thing, as Luke 19, 22.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:17"/> 2 Not properly. And then the part for the whole is put for gouerning, and ruling the world. So Chriſt ſaith, Iohn 5, 22, <hi>The Father iudgeth no man, but hath committed all iudgement to the Sonne.</hi> That is, gouerneth not the world, or ordereth the world without the Sonne, but by and with him. So is it Pſalme 98, 9, and oftentimes els where in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Que. How is it ſaid heere that God iudgeth, and Chriſt denieth that the Father iudgeth?</p>
            <p>Aunſ. Dauid ſpeaketh of God eſſentially, Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the Father perſonally, ſo as there is no odds. For the whole Trinitie iudgeth.</p>
            <p>And that God doth iudge the world, it is cleere, Gen, 18 25, Pſalm, 98, 9, and euen in particuler matters, as ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and Haires, much more in mens croſſes: ſo as that it ſhall be needleſſe further to ſhew it.</p>
            <p>Know then, 1 That nothing commeth by chaunce.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That all things howſoeuer they ſeeme to vs, of GOD are moſt wiſely done. Though I take it, that iudging here is yet ſomewhat more particularly taken for correcting, as 1, Cor: 11, 29, that which is tranſlated <hi>dammation,</hi> indeede is <hi>iudgement,</hi> that is, correction, ſo Pet: 1, 4, 17, <hi>iudgement must begin,</hi> that is, <hi>correction, at the houſe of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So as that whatſoeuer meanes are vſed, 1 Knowe that God ordereth croſſes. Thus thought Ioſeph, Iob, Dauid.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And that thereupon we ought alwaies to be patient. <hi>I held my peace becauſe thou diddest it. I will beare the wrath of the Lord, becauſe I haue ſinned against him.</hi> Yea, though it were to euerlaſting damnation.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Inſomuch that whatſoeuer meanes, yet GOD is to be ſought to for eaſe and fauour.</p>
            <p>This <hi>iudgement</hi> is heere, with limitation of time, <hi>When.</hi> Whereby is declared vnto vs, 1 That GOD doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies puniſh. Whereby he ſheweth his long ſuffering, &amp; our weakeneſſe: for if he ſhould, we were neuer able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That in the breathing time betweene croſſes, vvee
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1866:17"/>ſhould labour for ſpirituall wiſedome, ſtrength, faith, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, againſt the next affliction.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the <hi>iudgement,</hi> nowe followeth the <hi>pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pure,</hi> it is a borrowed kinde of ſpeech, from thinges not mixed, but ſheere, and like themſelues, not as troubled m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie water, or foming ſea, but as wine without water, ſiluer without droſſe.</p>
            <p>The meaning is, without any mixture of wrong dooing, or vnrighteouſneſſe, alwaies keeping one tenor of vpright dealing, accepting no perſon. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Who dareth doubt that God is thus? When hee forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth impuritie to his creatures, whoſe inheritance with him is vndefiled, who cannot be ſeene but by a pure hart.</p>
            <p n="1">1 VVell then, take heede of charging GOD with iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, euen in the matter of reprobation, much more in thine owne croſſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And endeuour to be pure and vpright, like thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father.</p>
            <p>Thus much of Dauids iudging himſelfe worthy of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, now follow the ſinnes which he doth confeſſe: and firſt actuall, in the 4 verſe: next, originall, in the 5, &amp; 6, verſes.</p>
            <p>Touching this, the Prophet firſt ſetteth it downe, then hee layeth it open. Hee ſetteth it downe in two manners of ſpeech; Firſt, <hi>I was borne in iniquitie:</hi> the ſeconde, <hi>and in ſame hath my Mother conceiued mee:</hi> both which are ſet out with the word, <hi>behold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But firſt let vs endeuour to vnderſtand the words, ſo ſhall we better know the ſence.</p>
            <p>The word which is read, <hi>borne,</hi> dooth properly ſignifie the time and griefe about the deliuerie, and being brought in bed. So as that Dauids meaning is, as ſoone as he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to the light, the darkneſſe of ſinne ouer-ſpred him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iniquitie,</hi> dooth heere ſignifie in the full and largeſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, to wit, guiltineſſe, that is, faultineſſe, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing puniſhment, &amp; withall, pronenes &amp; corruption to ſin.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:18"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Sin</hi> is tranſgreſſion of the Law, and the ſame with iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. The other word <hi>conceiued,</hi> properly cheriſhed, or heat or warmed me: that is, in the wombe from the conception and after, that is, as ſoone as euer the matter whereof I was made, was in the wombe, warme and encloſed, ſo ſoone, &amp; euen then, began I to be tainted.</p>
            <p>Not that bed companie betweene his Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and bed beneuolence (as ſome fondly haue thought) was ſin: but that euen from thence hee was infected. For the cleaneſt hand that is, ſowing pure wheate, can not cauſe, but when it ſpringeth it will haue ſtraw, chaffe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Whereupon by the way, it may ſeeme that ſin is drawne, as well from the mother as the Father, which the Papiſts ſeeme to denie. And whereas in the 5 to the Romans, it is aſcribed to man, there I thinke the woman is to bee inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>For the word, <hi>behold,</hi> which is ſo vſuall in the ſcriptures, I take it not as many learned doe, to note a wonder where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it is ſet, but according to the plaineneſſe of the ſtile of the ſcripture, to ſet out a thing commonly knowne, or that which may be, or ſhould be knowne. Gene: 22, 7. <hi>(Hinneni) ecce me.</hi> Almoſt 600 times in the ſcriptures, as Luke 7, 37, Iam: 3, 3, 4, and ſo often elſe where in the ſame ſence, as alſo here, beeing in ſuch a thing, as no ſeruaunt of God ſhould or can be ignorant of.</p>
            <p>The words thus opened, let vs come to the meaning of them altogether. The chiefe drift and intent, is to ſet out Dauids firſt ſin, which is heere noted to be, the <hi>iniquitie wherein he was borne,</hi> and the <hi>ſin wherein his Mother concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him.</hi> Which two manners of ſpeech, ſhew one and the ſelfe ſame thing. Which in another ſound of words is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Diuines about Saint Auguſtines time, <hi>Originall ſinne.</hi> Which howſoeuer Dauid ſaith is in himſelfe, is not onely true in him, but in all mankind, Chriſt onely excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as ſhortly we may perceiue.</p>
            <p>We may haue in this verſe a full ſetting out vnto vs what it is. For when Dauid ſaith, <hi>me,</hi> he meaneth his whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1866:18"/>ſoule and bodie: and when he mentioneth <hi>iniquitie</hi> &amp; <hi>ſinne,</hi> he meaneth fault, deſeruing of puniſhment, inclining to all corruption: and naming his <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>conception,</hi> hee ſheweth that it came from the firſt Mother to all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing children.</p>
            <p>But firſt of the name the learned Writers haue giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, which though in ſyllables it be not in Scripture, is grounded thereuppon, as Gen: 6, 5, and 8, 21.</p>
            <p>They call <hi>Originall</hi> or <hi>of beginning,</hi> 1 Becauſe it was fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning, as ſoone as euer the fall of Adam was.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It is one of the firſt thinges, that is with the childe in the conception.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It is the beginning of all ſinnes, of deede and practiſe. And thus familiarly may be ſhewed vnto vs to be: <hi>A diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of the whole man (touching matters of euerlasting life) or a decay of the image of GOD, brought vppon all mankinde (Christ onely excepted) by the fall of Adam and Eue, whereby they are ſubiect to the anger of God, and inclinable to any ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diſorder</hi> dooth ſignifie a ſwaruing from that, it was or ſhould haue beene at the firſt, and a continuing ſo. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is not onely, 1 The abſence of goodneſſe, &amp; vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but 2 the preſence of ſin and euill, 3 and inhabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in it ſelfe, to reforme it ſelfe. Theſe might bee prooued but for ſhortneſſe ſake.</p>
            <p>In the minde was &amp; ſhould haue continued, ful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God to ſaluation, with the comprehenſion of arts and creatures.</p>
            <p>The will delighted in Gods will: the affections were ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red holily to their due obiects, in moſt due ſort: the ſences likewiſe, and all other practiſes were thereafter. But nowe moſt is loſt, the contrarie come in, and will hardly be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The whole man,</hi> doth ſignifie ſoule and body, powers and parts. Gene: 6, 5. Gene: 8, 21.</p>
            <p>The firſt motions. Rom, 8, 7. The minde. Titus 1, 15, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
            <p>Yet muſt we not ſo meane, as though the ſubſtance were
<pb facs="tcp:1866:19"/>empaired, or the number of faculties, but as in a poyſoned fountaine, there is the water and the running, onely the wholeſomneſſe is taken away; ſo the ſoule and bodie, the parts and powers are the ſame, but the ſoundneſſe for their worke, to fit them to proper things in due ſort, is loſt.</p>
            <p>All this while this muſt be remembred, that wee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of matters of the ſpirit and euerlaſting life. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, natural men haue many excellent parts, for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie knowledge of the creatures, arts, policie, and ſuch like. So Paule ſheweth, 1, Cor, 2, 14.</p>
            <p>This commeth by the diſobedience of Adam and Eue, in whoſe loynes we were, who is our roote, with whom we ſtand or fall, of whoſe iuyce we ſauour and reliſh. For as in matters of treaſon, the Father tainteth all the blood, ſo is it in this caſe.</p>
            <p>The Parents propagate this, neither is it, as the Pelagians dreame, only by imitation. Rom: 5, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19. 1, Tim: 2, 14.</p>
            <p>And it ſpreadeth ouer all mankinde (Chriſt excepted) the Virgine Marie is not free.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it ſubiecteth to the wrath of GOD. Rom, 5, 18, and ſeauenth chapter, 24. verſe.</p>
            <p>Euen in the very regenerate. It is not imputed indeede, but yet there it is, howſoeuer the Tridentine gloſe, would corrupt the Canonicall text.</p>
            <p>Laſtly it inclineth to ſin. Rom: 7, 23. This neuer could the heathen vnderſtand.</p>
            <p>But heere foure queſtions are to be aunſwered.</p>
            <p n="1">1 What is the proper ſeate of this ſin? Aun. The whole man, but ſpecially the minde and will.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Againſt which commaundement is this ſinne? Aunſ. Againſt all and euery of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3 How commeth the ſoule to be infected with this ſinne, ſince it is immediatly created of God, and not begotten by the parents, as the body is?</p>
            <p>Aunſ. Better it were to ſeeke to ſhake it of, ſince euerie one muſt confeſſe that hee hath it, then curiouſly to ſearch
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1866:19"/>how he came by it, euen as to cure a ſoare, and lift out of a pit, rather then to ſtande queſtioning howe thoſe dangers came.</p>
            <p>Some thinke that this hangeth vpon the appointment of God, who gaue all things to Adam, not for himſelfe onely, but alſo for poſteritie, not as a priuate man, but as the roote and head; who ſtanding, all other ſhoulde continue vvith him, falling, bringeth all other downe: &amp; becauſe the ſoule is part of the partie, the body infected, cauſeth the ſoule to be ſo accounted. But this is not ſufficient.</p>
            <p>Others thinke, that the ſoule is indeede created at the firſt pure, but yet weake, and as ſoone as euer it is ioyned to the body, receiueth tincture and infection. Both aunſwers haue learned Authors, I like the laſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Can this ſin be quite taken away in this life?</p>
            <p>Aunſ. No, ſo as that it ſhould not be, but is taken away, as that in the elect &amp; regenerate, it is not imputed. For the reliques (as the Fathers ſpeake) are left to exerciſe vs with.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the opening of the words and meaning, ſee what we may further learne.</p>
            <p n="1">1 In that that Dauid being checked for one ſin, thinketh of more, and euen the roote of all, he doth as others of the children of GOD doe, and muſt doe, ſo ſeriouſly thinke of one ſin, as that they finde out others, euen as when one vſeth a light to ſeeke ſome one thing, hee thereby ſeeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>So thought Dauid of the ſinnes of his youth, Pſalm, 25.7. and others, Gene: 42, 21. Prou: 9.9. Wherefore, that is no good confeſſion, that findeth not out daily more and more ſinnes.</p>
            <p n="2">2 By the word, <hi>behold,</hi> we muſt remember, that our ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne ſhould be very well knowne, and thoroughlie perceiued of vs: but it is quite otherwiſe, few or none per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The more ſeeing into the hainouſneſſe of this ſinne, ſo we take heede of <hi>Flacias</hi> errors &amp; others, is good profiting in grace, otherwiſe then the Papiſts are wont to leſſen it.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:20"/> 4 Seeing this ſin is ſo naturall and engraffed, bred in the bone, we had neede arme our ſelues continually againſt it.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Preſume not too much of good naturall diſpoſitions, in matters of the worſhip of God, the beſt are infected with originall ſin, then which there is no worſe poyſon.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Parents muſt be carefull, that as they naturally beget their children, and ſo infect them with originall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they procure their regeneration to waſh away the filth heereof, by indeuouring to make them partake the merits of Chriſt, and alſo the power of his death, to deſtroy the body of ſin.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Neuer looke to be free in this life fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, neyther be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged if you take ſome foyles by it, wiſh to be clothed vppon.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the ſetting downe of this ſin, now folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the laying open of it, and making more cleere.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>6</label> Now the laying open of it, is in the 6 verſe, &amp; is by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring with the quite contrary in the firſt creation. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the heinouſneſſe of this will more cleerely appeare. For whereas God loueth truth in the inward affections, and teacheth wiſedome in the ſecret hart, is not Dauid out of ſquare, that from the firſt is confectioned with ſin? What a ſhame is it, that Gods will by my fault ſhould be violated? Now of opening, there is the

                  <item>Matter.</item>
                  <item>Notoriouſnes of it, as before</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The matter is in two ſpeeches, 1 <hi>Thou louest truth in the inward affections.</hi> 2 <hi>Thou teachest me wiſedome, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But firſt come to the wordes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Truth,</hi> in Scriptures ſignifieth diuerſly, more then need to be ſpoken of heere. In this place, I iudge it to be put for righteouſneſſe, as that which in Gene: 24, 49, our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh bookes haue <hi>truly,</hi> the 72 Interpreters haue <hi>dooing righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe:</hi> ſo is truth taken, Ephe: 4, 21, for true obedience, which is called righteouſnes, ver: 24. ſo Eſay 26, 2, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Nation is ſaid <hi>to keepe truth,</hi> by way of interpretation, to which purpoſe looke Eſay, 59, 14. but <hi>dooing of truth,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:1866:20"/>Iohn 3, 21, is moſt bright. So is it, I take it heere, ſincere obedience actually performed to the Law of GOD. It is called iuſtice, Ephe: 4, 24. And is a part of the image of God, by a meton: of the adiunct for the ſubiect.</p>
            <p>And is firſt heere named, becauſe it is more manifeſt, though not more neceſſarie then wiſedome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Louest,</hi> in the preterperfect Tence, and is alwaies true &amp; preſent in God, yet I take it, we may fitlieſt interpret in the preterpluperfect Tence, <hi>haddest loued,</hi> that is, diddeſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſo loue, as that at the firſt, thou createdſt man in it, &amp; art now angry with mee for hauing loſt it. For I iudge the Prophet hath reſpect to the image of God at the creation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inward affections,</hi> in Hebrew, the reynes, ſome ſay the hart ſtrings. A trope, ſhewing the ſeate of deſire and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they note is in the kidneis. Heereby the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet meaneth the will and affections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wiſedome,</hi> is knowledge mentioned. Coloſſ: 3, 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the ſecret of my hart,</hi> the Hebrew is onely <hi>in the ſecret,</hi> meaning indeede the heart, which is hid and couered with a filme, that it doth not appeare. He meaneth the mind &amp; vnderſtanding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hast taught,</hi> I thinke for <hi>haddest taught,</hi> as before reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the creation.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the words. Nowe becauſe one thing is meant in both theſe manners of ſpeech, therefore not curiouſlie ſpeaking of them a ſunder, let vs conſider them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to theyr intent.</p>
            <p>The Prophet laboureth to ſet out his corrupted eſtate, with that which was at the firſt creation, the which the Scriptures call by the image of GOD, which Dauid no doubt heere pointeth out.</p>
            <p>Now the image of GOD, is the likeneſſe to GOD, and was in
<list>
                  <item>Angels.</item>
                  <item>Men.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>VVe onely muſt conſider of it as it was in man, and is heere ſet downe to be <hi>truth in the inward affections, and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the ſecret hart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where by the way, note the error of the Anthropomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites,
<pb facs="tcp:1866:21"/>thinking God like to mans body: though <hi>Luther</hi> thinke they be falſly charged with this error.</p>
            <p>Now, in this deſcription of the image of God, wee may conſider in what parts, and what things this likeneſſe is.</p>
            <p>The parts are
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Inward affections.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secret hart.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>That is, as we heard before, the diſpoſition of the vvill, iudgement, and affections. Indeede mans ſoule is a ſpirit, ſomewhat like God, and had princedome ouer the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as a ſhadowe of Gods ſoueraigntie: but the ſeate of likeneſſe moſt principally is the hart, iudgement, &amp; affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>The things wherein this image is, firſt <hi>wiſedome</hi> or <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> Col: 3, 10, which the deuill can tell. Gene: 3, 5, and heere is called <hi>wiſedom,</hi> and is <hi>a full comprehenſion of thinges, to performance of the will of GOD, for happy estate in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This had with it, vnderſtanding of the morall Lawe, all artes, knowledge of all creatures, as in Adam, &amp; ſomwhat in Salomon.</p>
            <p>And this was engraffed that a man needed no Maiſter.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is <hi>iustice,</hi> Ephe: 4, 24. Full obedience to the wil of God in deſiring, thinking, willing nothing but Gods will. This is heere called <hi>truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe theſe things were loſeable, and indeede were loſt, which we neuer heere ſhall fully recouer.</p>
            <p>This is it which heere the Prophet ſo dolefully mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth for.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Shall we now neede to be put in minde, that the word <hi>behold,</hi> heere alſo dooth put vs in minde, that euery man ought to know theſe things, which few doe?</p>
            <p n="2">2 Or that alwayes thinking of this downfall, wee ſhould continually mourne?</p>
            <p n="3">3 Beſides, heere haue we a glaſſe to trimme our ſelues by, and a preſident, whereafter wee ought all to faſhion our ſelues.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:1866:21"/> 4 And that in the practiſe heereof, we ſhould begin from the reines and heart, where the ſeate of theſe things are, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, we bridle the horſe at the wrong end.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Laſtly, heere is matter enough for all a mans life tyme, ſo as that he cannot be idle, but had neede be repayring till he proue like God.</p>

            <p>Now followeth the ſecond particuler part, conſiſting of ſundry ſutes and deſires vnto God, from the beginning of the 7 verſe, to the middle of the 14.</p>
            <p>The firſt is verſe 7, A moſt earneſt deſire, and hath two branches: the firſt, for forgiuenes of ſinne; the ſecond, for imputation of righteouſneſſe, whereof both are conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and preſumed by faith.</p>
            <p>The firſt, <hi>purge me (as I perſwade my ſelfe thou wilt) with hyſope, I ſhall be cleane.</hi> Which is as if it were, If thou purge me &amp;c. Wherein the ſetledneſſe of faith, as in all other pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions enſuingly made, is to be remembred. In vaine is it to pray without ſome perſwaſion of beeing heard, when we haue commaundement to pray, promiſe to be heard, &amp; experience that others haue beene heard: as before hath beene declared.</p>
            <p>Of this firſt there be two members, whereof the one is cauſe, the other the effect. The cauſe, purging with hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſope; whereof one ſeemeth to be the principall, the other helping.</p>
            <p>The principall is <hi>purging.</hi> The ſignification and forme whereof is to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>The ſignification ſheweth, that hee deſireth to be made cleane from fault. Not that there ſhould be none in him, (for who is free?) but that it ſhoulde not bee imputed. Which though it neuer be in any partie ſeuered from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, yet for teaching ſake it ſo may be.</p>
            <p>The forme of the verbe is the future tence, for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiue moode, moſt vſuall in ſcriptures, which declareth
<pb facs="tcp:1866:22"/>a full aſſurance and perſwaſion of fayth.</p>
            <p>The helping cauſe is <hi>Hyſope,</hi> ſome tranſlate it <hi>moſſe:</hi> one thinketh it may be Roſemary, whereof theyr legall ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings might be made. But the Authour to the Hebrews, taketh away all doubt in the 9 chapter 19 verſe, hauing the word <hi>hyſope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the better vnderſtanding whereof, it will not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe to haue recourſe to the ceremoniall law. Where Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit: 14, 7, it is vſed in purging of Leproſie, and Numbers 19, 9. for leſſer vncleaneſſes, both which no doubt Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid thought of when he penned this: iudging of his ſinne, as of Leproſie, not neglecting the deſire to be purged euen from the leaſt. Mention likewiſe is made of Hyſop. Exod. 12.22. But the other meaning ought to like vs for the 9 to the Hebrewes.</p>
            <p>But ſome man may ſay. Why is there ſo often mention of Hyſope made?</p>
            <p>Aun. Not for that it hath any force of it ſelfe to clenſe the ſoule, but hauing ſome naturall propertie to open and clenſe the bodie, was appointed of God as it were a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall ſigne, and doth very fitly repreſent the blood of Chriſt, who clenſeth vs from all ſin. 1, Ioh, 1, 9, ſo doe the Bread and Wine in the Supper, water in Baptiſme, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now then this Hyſope is not for it ſelfe, but to repreſent the ſprinkling of the blood of Chriſt. 1, Pet, 1, 2, Hebr: 9, 14, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, that is, the death and ſufferings of Chriſt applied.</p>
            <p>So as that the Prophet deſireth the ſacrament of ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, with the fruite thereof.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore it is manifeſt, that hee vnderſtood the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies or ſacraments, as euery Chriſtian ſhould.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he knew that they all did tend to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and rather deſired the fruite thereof, then reſted in any outward act.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts abuſe this place for theyr holy water, firſt, whereas all ſuch legall ceremonies are dead euerlaſtinglie.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1866:22"/>Secondly, neither haue they any newe commaundement fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God. Thirdly, nor can they euer ſhew, that the ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for the act onely done (as in their holy water they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin) did good to the ſoule.</p>
            <p>Now in that the Prophet nameth this firſt, hee teacheth that our care ſhould be firſt &amp; greateſt for pardon of ſins, then all other things follow.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the cauſe: Now followeth the effect, <hi>and I ſhall be cleane.</hi> Metaphor: that is, I ſhall be free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fault. Whereby he ſheweth. 1 That by Chriſt he ſhall be fullie clenſed, ſo as that he ſhall need no other meanes to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any remainder by occaſion of ſinne: no there ſhall be no reliques to be ſatisfied for in Purgatorie.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this is ſolely by Chriſt, for hee ſpeaketh it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, that he ſhall be cleane, that is, by imputation.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt branch, the ſecond followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Waſh me, and I ſhall be whiter then ſnow.</hi> This is for impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of righteouſnes. Heereof there are two parcels, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the firſt the cauſe, the other the effect.</p>
            <p>The cauſe is in the word <hi>waſh.</hi> Whereby he eyther hath reſpect to the Prieſts waſhings of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, or the leprous perſons: but of this enough before. Which beſides purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is mentioned, becauſe Chriſt came as well by water as blood. Iohn 1, 5. water ſignifying full holineſſe.</p>
            <p>The effect, <hi>I ſhall be whiter then ſnow.</hi> An hyperbolicall metaphor: meaning, he ſhall be moſt perfectly cleane.</p>
            <p>Nowe by both theſe ſentences, one thing is principallie meant, as is often ſeene in the ſcriptures. In both which ioyntly we may conſider, 1 The neceſſitie of this iuſtice. 2 The deſire of it. 3 The commendation of it.</p>
            <p>The neceſſitie appeareth, in that the Prophet maketh it his firſt ſute, wherein alone is euerlaſting happineſſe, Pſal. 32, 1, 2. Rom: 4, 7. So as that indeede without this, there can be no fauour looked for at Gods hand. It is the vved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment, and the one thing neceſſarie, without the which, like Iacob in Eſaues clothes, wee neuer ſhal obtaine the bleſſing.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:23"/>
            <p> The deſire of it followeth. <hi>Purge mee with Hyſope, waſh mee.</hi> Wherein are, 1 The perſon purging and waſhing: 2 The thing where-with this purging is, <hi>Hyſope.</hi> 3 The partie receiuing, <hi>I Dauid, purge me.</hi> God, euen the whole Trinitie purgeth: the Father, for the Sonne, &amp; by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt. And that onely <hi>I, euen I for mine owne ſake put away thy ſinnes.</hi> Eſay 43, 25.</p>
            <p>God thus dooing this, is ſaid in ſcriptures to impute, that is, to account or recken, and is a borrowed kind of worde taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> debts or reckonings, as when I owe a great ſum, and my ſuretie paieth it for me, my creditour cancelling or deliuering my band, doth impute that payment vnto mee. This is not a putatiue righteouſneſſe, as the Papiſts falſelie charge it to be: where they fet themſelues againſt GOD, while theyr Prieſts take vppon them, the power and act of forgiuing ſinnes.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is the thing where-with this purging &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing is, and that is heere <hi>Hyſope,</hi> and <hi>water,</hi> ſignifying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs the full righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, which is his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto the death for vs.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is God and man, his man-hoode ſuffering, his God-head giuing merit thereto.</p>
            <p>His obedience is actiue, or paſſiue.</p>
            <p>His actiue, is the fulfilling of the morall law, in the rigor of it.</p>
            <p>His paſſiue righteouſneſſe are his ſufferings, from the beginning of his incarnation, to his reſurrection, which were very many, very grieuous, and with the feeling of the anger of God, and becomming a curſe.</p>
            <p>Both theſe are counted to vs, to the pardon of all ſinnes, fault, and puniſhment, and the counting of all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and fauours with that.</p>
            <p>Now that which is ſaid of Chriſt, is to be vnderſtoode of him alone, without mixture of any other thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer: nothing beſide beeing able to make ſo white, as Chriſtes righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>The third thing is the partie receiuing, &amp; that is Dauid.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1866:23"/>And here, as there is imputation on Gods part, there muſt be application in the partie praying, to wit, fayth. For as the ſprinkling of the Hyſope and water was receiued, ſo muſt Chriſt be. Heere therefore faith is moſt neceſſarie: to the full vnderſtanding vvhereof are neceſſarie to bee knowne, 1 The obiect. 2 The partes. 3 The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of it.</p>
            <p>The generall obiect of fayth, is the whole word of God, but more particulerly the doctrine of ſaluation by Chriſt, as the marrow and pith of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>The parts of fayth are three. The firſt knowledge, which is a perceiuing of the meaning of the worde of God, but eſpecially of ſaluation by Chriſt, which then we may iudge to be ſound, when we can diſcerne falſhood, when we reſt vpon grounds of Scripture, when nothing can driue vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, aſſent, which is a full perſwaſion, that the former is true.</p>
            <p>The third affiance or application, whereby wee are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that the word of ſaluation, and ſo ſaluation is ours. And heere indeede lieth the chiefe force of fayth, whereas the wicked may haue the other parts.</p>
            <p>The properties followe, 1 Commonly it is ſmall and weake. 2 It deſireth to increaſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It maketh the hart to thinke moſt highly of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4 It will change the whole man.</p>
            <p>The commendation of this iuſtice followeth, <hi>I ſhall be whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then ſnow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. How can this be, ſeeing euery where the Saints in Scriptures doe diſauow their owne righteouſneſſe, and are aſhamed of it?</p>
            <p>Aun. Righteouſnes is two-fold, of
<list>
                  <item>Iuſtification.</item>
                  <item>Sanctification.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>That which the Saints miſlike, is the imperfectneſſe of theyr ſanctification, not of iuſtification, which can haue no blemiſh. Indeede ſanctification is neuer ſeuered from a
<pb facs="tcp:1866:24"/>partie iuſtified, yet it muſt be diſtinguiſhed from iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Gather then from hence, 1 That Chriſtes righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe imputed vnto vs, is moſt perfect, that God cannot in the rigour of his iuſtice finde fault with it, els could not the Prophet by it be ſo white.</p>
            <p n="2">2 When wee conſider of righteouſnes to abide the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, all our owne, of neuer ſo inward ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt be remoued.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That perfectneſſe may ſtand with vnperfectneſſe, that is perfectneſſe of iuſtification, with imperfectnes of ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That all iuſtified parties, are iuſtified equally, euerie one partaking the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt. Mary and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab, Peter &amp; the theefe. It followeth not from hence, that glorie ſhould be equall.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the firſt particuler petition: the ſecond followeth in the 8 verſe,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe, </seg>8</label> 
               <hi>Make me to heare ioy and gladneſſe, that the bones which thou hast broken may reioyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This particuler deſire, is for the further confirmation of the former, and is a fruite of that. Wherein we may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two things. 1 That which is prayed for. 2 The end. That which is prayed for, is, <hi>Make me to heare ioy &amp; glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> The end, <hi>That the bones which thou hast broken, may reioyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that which is prayed for, we may conſider what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired from God to be beſtowed, then what of the Prophet to be receiued.</p>
            <p>That which God is deſired to giue, is to <hi>Make to heare.</hi> That which the Prophet would receiue, is <hi>ioy &amp; gladneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The manner of wordes, <hi>thou ſhalt make mee heare,</hi> it is in ſteed of <hi>make me to heare,</hi> by a very vſuall maner of ſpeech in the Hebrew tongue.</p>
            <p>Now ſurely, very fitly is this deſire ioyned to the former, as in the 32 Pſalme, after the doctrine of forgiuenes of fins, reioycing, verſe 11. So Rom, 5, 1.1, Iohn 1, 4. So as that without the former this can neuer be, and where the other
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1866:24"/>is, there this is.</p>
            <p>Howſoeuer the wordes heere ſtande, the firſt in nature, which the Prophet prayeth for, is <hi>ioy and gladneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ioy and gladneſſe,</hi> though they much agree in one, yet is the latter ſome increaſe of the former.</p>
            <p>Ioy is a ſweete motion in the ſoule, vpon opinion of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſome preſent good. Which according to the cauſe &amp; obiect is diuers. For when nature is delighted with anie thing pleaſing or preſeruing it, then is naturall or fleſhlie ioy, ſo when the regenerate part is delighted with ſome grace or heauenly thing, this is holy or ſpirituall ioy, which is chiefely meant in this place. Sometimes indeed God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth comfort of this world, but it is not generall, nor ſimply to be prayed for. This is a fruite of fayth. And is peace of conſcience increaſed, ariſing vppon the ſweet feeling of Gods loue in Chriſt, whereby wee can be cheerefull in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>
            <p>And that it is peace of conſcience increaſed, it is cleere. Bare peace is but quietneſſe, ioy muſt needes be more, and therefore followeth vpon peace. Pſal, 32, 11, Gala: 5, 22.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it is with ſuch a feeling of the fauour of God, as that it is part euen of the kingdom of God, Rom, 14.17. And therefore by Peter is called glorious ioy. 1, Peter, 1, 8.</p>
            <p>How it maketh to reioyce in afflictions, Paule ſheweth, Rom: 5, 3.</p>
            <p>Now no doubt Dauid prayeth for this, as it ſhould be in the children of God, for Paule 1, Theſ. 5, 16, requireth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to <hi>reioyce euermore,</hi> &amp; to the Phil: 4, 4, <hi>Reioyce in the Lord, and againe I ſay reioyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hauing thus in ſome ſort ſeene the meaning of this firſt branch, we cannot but learne ſomewhat by it.</p>
            <p>And firſt, that howſoeuer all ioy haue ſome ſweetneſſe, yet the Prophet deſireth none that is of the worlde: So ought we to doe, and if God ſend it, to endeuour to vſe it aright, which is very hard.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Againe, in that he is thus earneſt for this ioy, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb facs="tcp:1866:25"/>that eyther he had it not at all now, (as was moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by reaſon of his grieuous ſin) or not in ſuch meaſure as he longed for it. And ſure it is, that nothing quaileth &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layeth this ioy more then ſin.</p>
            <p n="3">3 A man may be in the fauour of God, and alwayes not feele ioy in the holy Ghoſt. Indeede it is an excellent gift, but ſuch as many times Gods children want, though neuer they want matter to make them reioyce.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt branch prayed for, the ſecond is <hi>gladnes:</hi> this is increaſed ioy. He feeling intolerable griefe for ſinne, can neuer be ſatisfied, but wiſheth all comfort to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hart. So did he Pſalm, 32, 11, and Phil: 4, 4.</p>
            <p>Nowe indeede well might the Prophet be ſtirred thus vp to pray, for the ſundry great cauſes of griefe, which hee might finde in himſelfe, as other the children of God, who ſometimes may be brought ſo low, as to think that all Gods comforts are too little for them.</p>
            <p n="1">1 So as that men muſt not giue ouer, though ſometimes they be brought ſo low.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Beſides, it is a good ſigne to find the want, and long for the hauing of this ioy, and the more the better.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the thing which on Gods part he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for, <hi>Make me to heare.</hi> Wherein is the Authour, and the meanes.</p>
            <p>The Authour is God, who onely can giue this ioy. Ioh: 16, 22. So as that it neuer can by any be taken away. To whom we muſt onely ſeeke.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The meanes is hearing. For this ioy beeing a fruite of fayth, is bred by the word of fayth, which eſpecially is the Goſpell: ſo as all muſt attend thereto.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In that he deſireth to be made to heare this ioy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ioy indeede is rather in feeling, he ſheweth that we muſt hang vpon the word, wayting againſt heereafter to be full poſſeſſed of this ioy, heere wee heare of it, after wee enter into it, according to that, <hi>Enter into the ioy of thy Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much of the thing, nowe followeth the end, <hi>That the bones which thou hast broken, may reioyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:1866:25"/>
            <p> It is allegoricall, that is, one thing is ſaide, and another is meant. The Prophets minde is to finde ſome ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, after great griefe, hee vſeth a compariſon of broken bones, which are meruailouſly painefull to any in whom they are, &amp; he ſeemeth to fetch this ſpeech from the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Lyons, who firſt breake the bones, &amp; then deuoure. So ſaith Ezechiah in his great griefe, Eſa, 38.13. <hi>He brake all my bones like a Lyon.</hi> For ſo in Daniel 6.24. are Lyons ſaid to haue broken the bones of Daniels enemies, ere euer they came to the ground. And therefore it is obſerued in the firſt booke of Kings, 13. chap. 27. verſe, that when the olde Prophet came, and found the body of the younger Prophet dead, that the Lyon had not eaten the carcaſſe, <hi>nor broken,</hi> (for ſo the Hebrew is) that is, the bones of <hi>the Aſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So as in the middeſt of this griefe of Dauid, he ſeemeth to himſelfe to ſee God as a fierce Lyon to come vpon him, and put him in great paine and more feare. All this is in the conſcience, ſo as that vnleſſe one haue felt the wound of ſpirit, hee could hardly geſſe, that it ſhould haue ſuch terrours.</p>
            <p>See in Dauid, that the greateſt griefes that are, doe not ſtraightway ſhew a deſperate eſtate? God can euen bring to the gates of hell, &amp; yet raiſe vp againe, as he did him.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And yet that it is a good thing, according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſinne, greatly to ſorrow. Our Sauiour liked it in the woman, that waſhed his feete with her teares.</p>
            <p n="3">3 But alwayes in the middeſt of terrours, we muſt take heede, we be not driuen from God, and onely poare vpon our griefes. For Dauid nowe could pray, that theſe his bones might reioyce, that is, that hee might feele as much comſort as he had felt ſorrow. Shewing, that as God can, ſo many times he doth ſend meruailous ioy after griefe.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the ſecond petition, a third followeth.
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe, </seg>9</label> verſe, 9. <hi>Hide thy face, &amp;c.</hi> Which is in part a repetition of that which was generally prayed for, in the firſt verſe of the Pſalme, &amp; is in it ſelfe, a deſire for to haue pardon of ſinne.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:26"/>
            <p> It conſiſteth of two branches bearing the ſame fruite, and ſignifying the ſame thing. The firſt braunch is, <hi>Hide thy face from my ſinnes.</hi> Which wordes are not in their proper meaning. <hi>Face,</hi> is put for the eyes, and eyes for ſight and knowledge, from vvhence ariſeth bewraying of miſlike. For when we ſee a thing that diſpleaſeth vs, we bewray our miſlike by our countenance. And therefore Dauid would haue God not to looke vpon his ſinne, leaſt he ſhould, as he iuſtly might, miſlike him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hiding,</hi> is, that Dauids ſinnes come not into Gods ſight.</p>
            <p>But heere may be a queſtion, How can any thing couer Gods eyes, who is all eye, and euery where?</p>
            <p>Aunſwere. Theſe thinges are not ſpoken properly, but to our capacitie, whereby Dauids deſire that God ſhould not ſo take knowledge of his ſinnes as hee ſhould puniſh them, is ſet downe. Indeede nothing can couer Gods eyes againſt his will: yet himſelfe may ſhut his eyes, or winke, as Acts, 17.30. and though hee cannot chooſe but knowe our ſinnes, yet he may chooſe, whether he will miſlike vs (being in Chriſt) or puniſh vs for them, which is the thing that Dauid deſireth.</p>
            <p>Now the onely veile that couereth Gods eyes from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding our ſinnes, is Chriſt, and his righteouſnes, which God the Father beholding, doth ſo like and take ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in, as that he reſpecteth not our vnworthines, nay loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king through Chriſt, doth account vs worthy.</p>
            <p>The other branch followeth, <hi>Put away all mine iniquities.</hi> Which becauſe it was in the beginning of the Pſalme, nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not heere to be treated of.</p>
            <p>Now followeth a fourth deſire in the 10. verſe. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe, </seg>10</label> 
               <hi>Create in me a cleane heart, &amp;c.</hi> And this is for ſanctification: as alſo hath two parts in it, whereof the one dooth ſerue to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the other.</p>
            <p>The former is, <hi>Create in me a cleane hart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heart,</hi> is not put for the fleſhy part of the body, but for the ſoule, which keepeth eſpeciall reſidence there, and not for the ſubſtance and powers, but qualities; and though it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1866:26"/>be all ouer the body, yet hath it the chaire of eſtate in the heart, according to the Scriptures, otherwiſe then ſome Philoſophers &amp; Phiſitions write, that it is in the braine.</p>
            <p>So as that the Prophet here meaneth the very fountaine, and head ſpring of life and all functions thereof.</p>
            <p>This is the more to be marked, for the order, in that hee deſireth to haue the heart wrought vpon: becauſe that, 1 vvithout the heart, nothing will be cleane in man.</p>
            <p n="2">2 With the heart alwayes the reſt of the ſoule and body followeth.</p>
            <p>It is therefore all our duties, to labour to haue our hearts wrought vpon firſt. For as the heart in the body, the root in the tree firſt are made; ſo muſt it be in grace, the heart and ſoule muſt be ſetled firſt.</p>
            <p>After he prayeth to haue this <hi>cleane,</hi> that is, free, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie from the guilt of ſinne, but from the filth and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, which is eſpecially meant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Creating,</hi> to ſpeake properly, is to make of naught, and is vſed heere vnproperly. The Prophet ſpeaketh accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne feeling, and preſent iudgement of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as though he had loſt all, and had no goodnes in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. No doubt the Prophets heart was in part cleane, though not ſo much as he deſired.</p>
            <p>Theſe thinges thus opened, heere commeth a queſtion firſt to be aunſwered.</p>
            <p>Queſt. Whether Dauid could haue loſt the cleanenes of heart, hauing once had it?</p>
            <p>Aun. No. The gifts and calling of God, that is (as I take it) the gifts of effectuall calling, are ſuch as God neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth of or taketh away. Faith, hope, and charity, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding gifts, as ſure as the election of God, which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable. Indeede the children of God, if we only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered them in themſelues with their enemies, might fall away, but being founded vpon the vnchangeable nature of God, and immutability of his counſaile, they cannot, the gates of hell ſhall not preuaile againſt them, the elect cannot be deceaued or plucked out of Chriſtes hands.
<pb facs="tcp:1866:27"/>Nay, certaine it is, that Dauid did not actually leeſe his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer cleaneneſſe. For ſure it is his heart ſmiting him (as heere it did) ſo dooing before in leſſe matters, it was not wholy voide of cleaneneſſe. And againe, it could not pray for cleaneneſſe, if it were not ſomwhat cleane.</p>
            <p>This is moſt ſure, that by greeuous ſinnes much filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe commeth to the ſoule, as by a boiſtrous winde a tree may looſe his leaues and ſome branches, ſo as that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſinning, may be brought into as great paſſions almoſt as if he had loſt all, but the deſire of the grace is an vnfalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble certainty of ſome grace of that kinde.</p>
            <p>The Prophet therefore deſireth not a cleane heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had it not in no ſort, but becauſe he could not ſo well perceaue it in himſelfe, and take ſuch comfort in it, as he had done before, and for that he deſired it a great deale more then now he had it. So learned, ſo ritch men thinke themſelues not learned, not ritch, in reſpect of that which they doe deſire, and when the Sunne is vp, the Moone ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue no light.</p>
            <p>Well then, in that the Prophet deſireth this cleane heart, whereas ſundry other parts were vncleane beſides, he ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that, 1. of all vncleaneneſſe, that which is of the heart is moſt filthy, there being (as it were) the common ſinke of all ſinne in a man, ſo as that howſoeuer the chanels be cleanſed, if the draine be not, little cleaneneſſe will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In that his filthineſſe maketh him pray for freſh clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as though he had not any, ſee to what a paſſe ſome groſſe ſinne may bring a man vnto, euen to doubt of his eſtate, touching his cleanſing, and ſo being in the fauour of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3 No doubt it is a very hard thing to cleanſe a heart, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie able to be done by God himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 There is none but with Dauid may finde filthineſſe in his heart, from whence hee might deſire to haue it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. For this purpoſe reade Mar. 7.21.22. and 2. Cor. 7.2.</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:1866:27"/> 5 Now Dauid ſo prayeth for a cleane heart, as that hee dooth not neglect pure handes, &amp;c. A pure heart will cleanſe the whole body and ſoule, whereſoeuer it is. Pſal. 24.4.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Neuer can any of the children of God, content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with the begun cleaneneſſe which they haue, but they alwayes will be growing in it.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Nowe ſeeing it is thus, it is our parts to deſire cleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as well as Dauid. For that with it we ſhall ſee God. Math. 5, 8. Looke Pſal. 24.4. Heb. 12, 14.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Now God onely worketh this. Ezech. 36, 26.</p>
            <p>By his worde, faith, and Spirit, regenerating and renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>But heere a queſtion may be made.</p>
            <p>Queſt. How may one know, whether his hart be cleane, yea or no?</p>
            <p>Aunſwere. If hee haue the former things, whereby it is wrought. Beſides a cleane heart, 1. vvill deſire to haue cleane hands, and ſo euery part and power of ſoule and body, 2. vvill hate euen the garment ſpotted of the fleſh, 3. vvill neuer flatter it ſelfe in ſecret, 4. vvill be willing to be examined: vncleane perſons will be loath to be found in their filth.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the former part, the latter followeth, and is almoſt the ſame with the former. Firſt ſomewhat for the words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spirit,</hi> among many things in Scripture which it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, is heere put for the motion and ſtirring of the mind. So Luk. 9, 55. Num. 14.24.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Right,</hi> doth ſignifie ſetling, 1. In the fauour of God, 2. and obedience to him.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe, </seg>11</label> Thus much of the fourth petition, nowe followeth the fift, in the 11. verſe, and ſeemeth to be a deprecation, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to haue ſome kind of puniſhment kept from him.</p>
            <p>Some take it to be all one with that which went before, neuertheleſſe I take it to be diſtinguiſhed from the former. For although ſometimes in one verſe the latter is all one with the former, yet is it not wont ſo to be in diuers verſes, and eſpecially in ſuch ſhort Scriptures, but vpon ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall occaſion.</p>
            <p>This deſire then containeth a requeſt, to haue particuler iudgements or puniſhments kept from the Prophet. For to the fault of ſinne, belong diuers rods &amp; ſcourges, which the Prophet heere feareth.</p>
            <p>Now this deſire hath two parts. The firſt, <hi>Cast me not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from thy preſence,</hi> the other, <hi>take not thy holy ſpirit from me.</hi> In both the which the Prophet Dauid ſeemeth to haue reſpect to Gods dealing with Saul, whom he caſt off from being King, as to haue the kingdom to continue in his line, and from whom likewiſe he tooke his good ſpirit.</p>
            <p>The <hi>preſence</hi> or face of God in Scripture ſignifieth ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things, which were too long to recite: heere it contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth three things. 1. Fauour of God, 2. The place of the worſhip of God, whence the face and fauour of God may be perceaued So Gen. 4.10.14. Ion. 1.3. 1. Sam. 26.19.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Seruice before or in the preſence of God. Which in Dauid was his ſeruice in gouerning the kingdome. So Math. 18.10. Iob 1.6. Eſth. 1.14.</p>
            <p>Theſe the Prophet deſireth not to leeſe.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1866:28"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Cast me not,</hi> take not theſe away from me in an anger, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe I ſhall endeuour to beare the loſſe patiently.</p>
            <p>Firſt now let vs learne by Dauid calling to minde Gods dealing toward Saul, to profit and be the wiſer for Gods puniſhments in others.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Let vs a little enquire, whether this fauour the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet feareth to leeſe, be for and to ſaluation, or in thinges onely belonging to this life? For the clearing wherof ſome ſentences muſt firſt be ſet downe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Dauid had the fauour of God to ſaluation.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Dauid could neuer fully and for euer looſe it.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Dauid might haue the feeling of it ſo impaired, as that he might feare that he ſhould looſe it.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Neuertheleſſe this fauour is not heere meant: but that fauour whereby God firſt gaue Dauid the kingdome, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncing him to the honour of being Gods Lieuetenant to gouerne his people, in hauing God for his defence and grace, as Saul had for a time. Which fauour among out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, is the greateſt in the world.</p>
            <p>This Dauid deſireth may not be taken from him, not ſo much for the kingdome ſake: as 1. That God might not bewray to others, that he was diſpleaſed with Dauid.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That Dauid might not by occaſion heereof, cauſe the aduerſaries to blaſpheme.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That yet Dauid might haue his high place, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence he might make open confeſſion and acknowledging of his fault to all his kingdome.</p>
            <p>Thus much for that queſtion.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Now all that are aboue others, if they meane to keepe their wealth, &amp; honours in the fauour of God, they muſt take heede of ſinne.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Since that kingdomes are taken from Princes, and ſo meruailous changings and troubles come, wee had neede pray for Kings that they ſinne not, and if they ſinne, that they may repent.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That euen for ſinnes, God taketh away outward fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:29"/> 4 That in outward callings, men ſhould remember to labour in them, as ſeruing before the face of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That in the leſſer matters, as any outward thing, it greeueth the ſeruant of GOD, to ſee any diſpleaſure of God.</p>
            <p>Hitherto the firſt part, the ſecond followeth, <hi>Take not thy holy ſpirit from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spirit,</hi> dooth heere ſignifie the gift of the Spirit, as elſe where in Scriptures.</p>
            <p>I doe not thinke that the Prophets meaning is, to ſpeake of the ſpirit, which is called of ſanctification (which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer a man may feare to leeſe, can neuer yet fully be loſt) but of the good ſpirit of the holy God, which ſpirit is ſaid to haue departed from Saul. 1, Sam. 16.14, Saul had not the ſanctifying ſpirit of God (vnleſſe onely in reſtraining him.) Indeede he is ſaid to be an other man, that is, furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with other gifts then he had before, whereby he was enabled to gouerne the kingdome, as in the booke of Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the ſpirit of the Lord is ſaid to come vpon the Iudges, that is, the worke of the ſpirit, in ſundry gifts and abilities of the ſpirit for gouernment in warre and peace.</p>
            <p>As Saule therefore loſt ſuch gifts, ſo Dauid prayeth he may not, to wit, loue of his Countrey and people, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, courage, making good lawes, felicity, or good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</p>
            <p>He teacheth vs then, 1. That ſinne deſerueth not onely the impairing of ſauing graces, but the loſſe euen of gifts meete for a mans particuler vocation. So God threatneth Mal. 2.2. to curſe their bleſſings, and ſaith, Ezech. 20, 26. That he polluted them in their gifts, ſo Nabuchadnezzar is ſaid to be turned into a beaſt, Dan. 4. That is, to looſe the vſe of reaſon: after the ſame manner Nabal became a ſot or a ſtone. 1, Sam. 25.37.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That euen the gifts of a mans calling, are from the Spirit of God, ſo as not the meaneſt calling or gift belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto, is to be deſpiſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That euery one is to endeuour to haue, to preſerue
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1866:29"/>and increaſe the gifts of his calling.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Now as all gifts are good, ſo thoſe which are for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of family, cittie, or kingdome, are moſt excellent.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Mention of the holy Spirit is made to teach vs, that all duties are to be done holily.</p>
            <p>They are done holily, when: 1 Firſt the kinde of life is warrantable by the word of God, that is, when it any way ſetteth out the glory of God, or procureth good to others.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The party performing any dutie is in Chriſt, &amp; repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for ſinnes.</p>
            <p n="3">3 He doth the duties for conſcience to God, &amp; as in the preſence of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4 In the vndertaking of duties he calleth vpon God.</p>
            <p>Hetherto the fift petition, the ſixt followeth, verſe 12. <hi>Restore me to the ioy of thy ſaluation. &amp;c.</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋerſe, </seg>12</label> Wherein hee deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to haue the gifts of the Spirit giuen him againe, which he had loſt, by reaſon of his ſinne. For ſinne doth mightilie daunt and dull the graces of the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Of this petition there are two parts: one, to haue the ioy of Gods ſaluation, the other to be eſtabliſhed with Gods free Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Restore,</hi> dooth properly ſignifie to returne that which is not a mans owne to the proper owner. But ſo can it not be taken heere. For all things are properly Gods, nothing our owne. Heere therefore Dauid deſireth to haue thoſe things giuen him againe, which he had before, and hath now loſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ioy,</hi> doth ſignifie cheerefulnes of hart. Looke verſe 8. &amp; with it alwayes ſeeking vppon conceit of want, hoping to haue in ſeeking, reſting in hauing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saluation,</hi> doth not here ſignifie the eſtate of bleſſed life, but outward ſafetie, when as the prophet can, wanting any thing, come cheerefully to God, ſeeke to him, be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of his helpe, and finde it. So is it Exod, 14, 13. Pſalm. 3, 3. and that we ſo may vnderſtand it heere may appeare, becauſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1 That euerlaſting ſaluation can neuer be loſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 God for ſins taketh away outward ſafety &amp; deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:30"/> 3 God dooth threaten ſome ſuch thing to Dauid by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, 2, Sam, 12, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>Now this outward ſaluation, or ſafetie ſpoken of, hath with it, 1 Gods promiſe to helpe: 2 and certaine perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof.</p>
            <p>Note then 1 that ſinners not repenting, haue no ſecurity euen of outward eſtate, nor can haue any hart to ſeeke vnto God: it is otherwiſe with the godly, God hedged Iob.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That Gods children, euen in their proſperitie, ioy more in Gods fauour to them, then in all outward things.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Now howſoeuer Dauid heere prayeth for outward things ſimply, he vnderſtandeth conditions, 1 according to the will of God, 2 as farre as God ſeeth good for him, 3 ſo as alwaies by them hee may the more be perſwaded of Gods loue to him: ſo muſt we.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Dauid aſcribeth all outward ſafety to God, what means ſo euer he had, ſo muſt we.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Dauid felt Gods ſauing of him, men muſt not vſe the benefits without ſome feeling of them, that they may the more be thankfull for them.</p>
            <p>Hetherto the former part, now followeth the latter. <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh me with. &amp;c.</hi> Wherein wee may conſider two things, the kind of fauour hee prayeth for, and the matter wherein he would haue that fauour appeare.</p>
            <p>The kinde is in the word <hi>stabliſh,</hi> &amp; is a borowed ſpeech, ſignifying to make ſteadie, to hold by the hand, elſe hee ſhould fall.</p>
            <p>God vpholdeth all things by his word and power, and ſo doth he euery creature, euen the wicked: but he vpholdeth his Church and children more eſpecially with his grace &amp; loue, as a mother or nurſe the child, which is like to fall, this vpholding or eſtabliſhing is vnderſtood heere.</p>
            <p>Now this is the aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, whereby the child of God is vpheld daily in the duties of the worſhip of GOD, and his particuler calling. This hath alwaies in it, 1 truth, 2 frequentation, 3 continuance, which is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vnderſtood.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:1866:30"/>
            <p> I gather then from hence: 1 That from the corruption of ſinne in a man, a man may often fall into the ſame ſinnes.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That God onely can vphold them. They who deſire to be vpheld by God, muſt lay their foundation in ſaluation by Chriſt: 2 They muſt vſe all meanes: 3 That vnleſſe a man be eſtabliſhed, all is in vaine.</p>
            <p>The matter wherein he would haue this fauour ſhewed, is Gods free ſpirit. <hi>Spirit,</hi> doth ſignifie (I iudge) the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the minde, ſtirred by the Spirit of God, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence all good things in vs ſhould proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Free,</hi> doth ſignifie that which the Latines call ingenious, which hath in it, 1 honeſtie, 2 cheerefulneſſe.</p>
            <p>This if it be wanting, maimeth all duties.</p>
            <p n="1">1 This, ſin quencheth: ſo as whereſoeuer this is abſent, ſinne is preſent.</p>
            <p n="2">2 All muſt indeuour for ſuch a ſpirit: onely Chriſt &amp; his Spirit worketh ſuch an one. We may know it thus.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It alwaies will be buſie in the duties of godlineſſe, and ones priuate calling.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It is glad when it hath any occaſion to doe ſuch dutie.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It is diligent, firſt and laſt.</p>

            <p> Now in this dutie, we may marke the thing the Prophet ſaith he will doe, and the parties to whom.</p>
            <p>The thing is, teaching Gods waies: the parties are, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that is, ſinners not repenting,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Who haue neede of teaching.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Whom we may be with by vertue of our calling to doe them good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Teach,</hi> a man is ſaide to doe when hee cauſeth to learne. This a man doth by 1 example, 2 in deede, 3 in word.</p>
            <p>Heere we muſt vnderſtand it of word and example: ſo as that,</p>
            <p n="1">1 We muſt ſpeake things of inſtruction to others.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Be the firſt our ſelues that muſt doe them.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Now what kind of teaching this ſhould be, looke pſal. 32, 8.</p>
            <p n="4">4 So as that euery one ſhould be carefull of the ſaluation of each other: and this worke may beſeeme a King, beeing as carefull to teach as to correct.</p>
            <p>He will teach, but <hi>thy wayes,</hi> that is, Gods wayes.</p>
            <p>Gods waies are either ſuch as himſelfe walketh in, or ſuch as he will haue his ſeruaunts walke in.</p>
            <p>Both may be well vnderſtoode in this place, ſo as that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ought to know how God dealeth with conuerts, and what courſe conuerts are to take to continue in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of GOD.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the dutie, the effect is, <hi>and ſinners ſhall be conuerted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sinners,</hi> are the ſame with the wicked.</p>
            <p>Heere might at large be handled the doctrine of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of a ſinner to God, otherwiſe called repentance.</p>
            <p>Somewhat may heere briefely be touched.</p>
            <p>Conuerſion being ſaid to be in men, is taken
<list>
                  <item>largely.</item>
                  <item>ſtraightly.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Largely, for any change. Straightly, for that vvhich in Scripture is called repentance.</p>
            <p>Some vnderſtand it heere for that change which is in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1866:32"/>man, from the feeling of his owne wretchedneſſe and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to the mercie of God. This is true, but not ſufficient &amp; full.</p>
            <p>But I take it to be to be vnderſtood in the ſecond ſence, as moſt often in the ſcriptures the Prophet moſt fitly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it out to be turning to God.</p>
            <p>Turning vnto, implieth a former turning away, as indeed euery ſinner is out of the way, whatſoeuer they ſeeme to themſelues, or others.</p>
            <p>This turning is indeede a change, not of the ſubſtance, not of the powers, but onely of the properties in deſires, &amp; practiſes of the ſoule and body.</p>
            <p>The qualities and properties which muſt be in a partie thoroughly turned to GOD, are of the faculties: 1 to fit themſelues to their proper obiects, as to know, remember, ſee, heare, &amp;c. that which it ſhould: 2 to doe their duties in them cheerefully and conſtantly of the deſires and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, that they be becauſe they pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>This turning is to GOD, which is, when a man in all things conſulteth with the word of God, 2 and endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to doe all thereafter, 3 neuer giuing ouer till in ſome fort he ſo can doe.</p>
            <p>But that we may the better vnderſtand this turning, let vs conſider the cauſes, the parts, the properties, and the marks of it.</p>
            <p>The principall, efficient, or making cauſe, is the Spirit of God, making a man anew. Ierem, 31, 18.</p>
            <p>The inſtrumentall is the word of God.</p>
            <p>The matter is whole man in ſoule and body.</p>
            <p>The forme is according to the image of God.</p>
            <p>The vtmoſt end, the glory of God, other middle ends, 1 to certifie our owne conſciences touching our adoption, 2 the edifying of our brethren.</p>
            <p>The properties are many.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It beginneth from within, and is moſt carefull to haue the hart firſt turned to God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It neuer can long lie hid, though it deſire not much to
<pb facs="tcp:1866:33"/>ſhewe it ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It is alwaies increaſing, auoyding the ſinnes the party is moſt inclined vnto, endeuouring for graces &amp; duties moſt neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="4">4 In this life it is imperfect.</p>
            <p n="5">5 It is wiſe, and maketh great account of great, and ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler account of ſmaller things: ſo preferring the duties of the worſhip of God, as that it neglecteth not the duties of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler vocation, and ſo performeth them as yet the hart is principally to God.</p>
            <p>The parts are
<list>
                  <item>Mortification.</item>
                  <item>Viuification.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Mortification, is the continuall leſſening of the practiſe and power of ſinne: and ſtriketh at, all it can, at originall ſinne.</p>
            <p>Viuification is a continuall renewing and quickening to all holy duties, and appeareth in the deſire, purpoſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to doe well, recouering it ſelfe againe after ſlippes.</p>
            <p>Now follow the properties: which can not eaſilie be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by all.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Cannot be found in them who are not conuerted: 2 not eaſily in ſuch as are babes in Chriſt: 3 not of any while they are in the fit of greeuous tentations, eſpecially of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularitie.</p>
            <p>In others they may be found. Some of them are:</p>
            <p n="1">1 A willingnes to ſet a mans ſelfe in the preſence of God, to thinke of death, the law, the latter iudgement, hell.</p>
            <p n="2">2 A true hatred of ſin, yea of euery ſin, and that in a mans owne ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="3">3 A deſire of ſpirituall nouriſhment, word, ſacraments.</p>
            <p n="4">4 A loue of ſuch as are truly conuerted.</p>
            <p n="5">5 A delight in heauenly things, and preferring them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world.</p>
            <p>But heere a queſtion may ariſe, whether ſinners vvhen they knew that Dauid was againe in fauour with GOD, did conuert?</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:1866:33"/>
            <p> Aun. Dauid ſpeaketh not ſo much of the effect, as of the ſufficient cauſe, and iuſt occaſion. It is hard for a man by the effects to iudge that the meanes were neuer vſed. Good meanes may make one preſume of a good end.</p>
            <p>Now if Dauid deemed that vpon his finding fauour with God, ſinners would turne, what might we doe vpon ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and great meanes.</p>
            <p>Beſides, Dauid ſheweth, that the beſt thing for a ſinner to doe, is to conuert.</p>
            <p>And that if ſinners co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert vpon the knowledge of Gods mercie to Dauid, how would the godly profit?</p>
            <p>Hetherto hath been the digreſſion,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe. </seg>14</label> now followeth a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth petition in the former part of the 14. verſe, whereof are two parts, the thing it ſelfe, and the author of the gift.</p>
            <p>The thing is to be deliuered <hi>from blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some learned interpreters, by bloods vnderſtand tragical examples, and bloody euents in Dauids ſtocke and houſe: but they cannot well proue this.</p>
            <p>I thinke it ſignifieth manſlaughter, and murder. For Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid now thought vpon the murdering of his moſt faithfull ſeruaunt Vriah, &amp; ſlaughter of the other in his band: thus are bloods often taken in Scripture. Gene, 4, 10. &amp;c. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid prayeth that that fact be not layd to his charge.</p>
            <p>After generall confeſſion, a man muſt come to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>Deliuery is freedome from the fault and puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Let vs then learne from hence, 1 that ſeeing Dauid was aboue the compaſſe of manslaw, and yet calleth himſelfe to a reckoning for ſinne by the word of God, other ſo ought to doe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 What an horrible ſinne murder is.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Particuler ſinnes knowne, muſt particulerly be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The ſame ſinnes will often recourſe, and accuſe the conſcience.</p>
            <p>The Author followeth, who is repeated, with a ſpeciall fauour of his.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:34"/>
            <p> The Authour is God, and is here repeated, as a note of faith and boldneſſe in the Prophet. Whereby hee ſheweth, that God, can, will, and that Dauid looketh for helpe.</p>
            <p>And the Prophet doth the rather repeate it, 1 to affect himſelfe with the conſiderations of Gods maieſtie, 2 and to ſtirre himſelfe vp to pray with his hart, 3 and with all to ſhew how impatient faith is of delaies.</p>
            <p>Now this fauour is ſaluation of

            <p>Hetherto hath beene the ſecond ſpeciall part of this pſalme in petitions, now followeth the 3, which is thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, from the latter part of the 14. verſe to the 18.</p>
            <p>To this praiſing is there a paſſage made, verſe 14, 15, &amp; a ſetting downe of the dutie of prayſing in the reſt.</p>
            <p>The paſſage hath the profeſſion of this dutie, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the ſpeech.</p>
            <p>The profeſſion is in the latter part of the 14. verſe, and hath in it, 1 the kind of dutie, 2 the inſtrument, 3 the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>The kinde of dutie is ſinging with ioyfulnes, which hath great vehemencie, boldneſſe, and cheerefulneſſe.</p>
            <p>Vehemencie is in earneſt ſetting of the minde.</p>
            <p>Boldneſſe in perſwaſion, that the dutie pleaſeth God.</p>
            <p>Cheerefulneſſe is whereby we readilie vpon the occaſion giuen, breake out into the praiſes of God, and are glad that we haue occaſion ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>The inſtrument is the tongue, the minde is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. 1 God will haue the whole man: 2 others muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by vs be prouoked.</p>
            <p>Neither did the tongue onely ſing, the hand played. So muſt wee, all the waies we can, teſtifie our deſire of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God.</p>
            <p>But ſome man may ſay, what doth muſicke helpe to the prayſe of God?</p>
            <p>Aunſ. Nothing ſimply: 1 by it the minde of the ſinger is ſhewed: 2 and ſomtimes the mind dull, is ſtirred vp.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1866:34"/>
            <p> The matter is the <hi>righteouſnes of God.</hi> This is the dittie of his ſong.</p>
            <p>The iuſtice of God doth heere ſignifie the truth of God in keeping his promiſe, as Rom, 3, 25, 26, to wit, towards ſinners repenting. So likewiſe in the Syriac tongue, iuſtice is put for mercie.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Now Dauid thus ſingeth euen in the houſe of his pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage. Pſalm, 119, 54.</p>
            <p n="2">2 He doth not therefore ſing amorous ſongs.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Now indeede, as all the ſtatutes are to be our ſongs, that is our delight to meditate in, ſo eſpecially Gods promiſes of mercie toward repentant ſinners.</p>
            <p n="4">4 May not this be ſome comfort, that hee calleth Gods mercy iuſtice: ſo as that God ſhould not be iuſt, if he were not mercifull to ſinners according to his promiſes?</p>
            <p>Hetherto the profeſſion of dutie, now followeth the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the ſpeech, <hi>open my lippes. &amp;c.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon, for that God is not delighted with ſacrifice, neither wiſheth burnt offerings.</p>
            <p>I thinke the verſe might better bee diſtinguiſhed thus. <hi>Thou art not delighted with ſacrifice. Thou deſirest no burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering though I would giue it.</hi> For the ſpeech increaſeth, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is burnt offering then ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>But firſt know the meaning of the words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sacrifice</hi> properly ſo called, is a part of the Iewiſh vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, where ſomewhat was offered to God.</p>
            <p>It was of two ſorts. 1 Propitiatorie, to procure fauour with GOD. 2 Gratulatory, to witneſſe thankſgiuing to God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is meant in this place: and that was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times burnt offring, which all was burnt and offered vp to God. Sometimes called ſacrifice when ſome beaſt was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but part was reſerued for the offerer, part for the prieſt, part offered to God.</p>
            <p>That which in Engliſh is tranſlated <hi>deſirest,</hi> were better, <hi>art not delighted with,</hi> ſpoken after the manner of men, that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1866:35"/>is, dooſt neither commaund that I ſhould offer it, nor dooſt ſo approue of it, when I offer it.</p>
            <p>That which is tranſlated <hi>delightest not in,</hi> were better <hi>wilt not,</hi> that is, dooſt not care for.</p>
            <p>We are wiſely for all this to vnderſtand this deniall, for it may ſeeme ſtrange that God ſhould not like of that which himſelfe commaunded, as ſacrifice, &amp; burnt offerings. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore God liketh not theſe ſacrifices onely, and for the deede done as ſundry performed them. 2 He liketh them not ſo much as he doth the other of a broken hart. For ſo denialls are by way of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon. Looke Hoſea 6, 6, Ioel 2, 13. 1, Pet, 1, 12. Thirdly, God liketh them not, as the Iewes many times performed them. Looke Eſay 1, &amp; the 66. chapters.</p>
            <p>Que. Did the Iewes reſt onely in outward things, &amp; had not thoſe of the life to come.</p>
            <p>Aun. No. The elect Iewes enioy euerlaſting life, as well as any of vs ſhall.</p>
            <p>Que. What difference is betweene the Iewes and the Chriſtians this way?</p>
            <p>Aun. In the maine matters of ſaluation nothing, the ſame God, the ſame Chriſt, the ſame Spirit, the ſame word, the ſame faith, hope and charitie, &amp;c. In outward things ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, they had more ſacraments then the Chriſtians, the outward matter of them was diuers, the continuance was not for euer, as the Chriſtians are, things were not ſo cleere among them, as among the Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Que. Why did God ordaine that, which afterward hee did aboliſh?</p>
            <p>Aun. The fulnes of time was not yet come, and GOD would breake the proude hart of the Iewes by theſe ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny duties.</p>
            <p n="1">1 By this wee may perceiue, that a man may doe duties which God hath commaunded, and yet not pleaſe God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That nothing will pleaſe God from vs, onely for the deede done, without inward motion of the mind, with faith in Chriſt, with deſire to pleaſe God, by endeuouring accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:1866:36"/>to Gods commaundements.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Sometimes it ſo may fall out, that a man may omit ſome outward dutie, without any great fault.</p>
            <p n="4">4 When there is ſome cauſe that ſome-what of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God ſhould not be performed, neuer omit the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.</p>
            <p n="5">5 If in Dauids time ſacrifices were not alwaies needfull, what ſhall we now thinke after Chriſt, of the abhominable ſacrifice of the maſſe?</p>

<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe, </seg>17</label> ſhewing what are the moſt acceptable ſacrifices to God. Now this part hath in it, the reckoning vp of theſe ſacrifices, and the commendation of them.</p>
            <p>The reckoning of them ſetteth downe two, <hi>a broken ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, a broken and contrite hart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation ſheweth, that 1 they are ſacrifices, that is in ſteed of all, 2 of God, 3 ſuch as God deſpiſeth not.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>hart,</hi> ſignifie as before in the 10. verſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Broken and contrite,</hi> ſpeeches taken from things beaten into diuers peeces.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Contrite,</hi> beaten as it were to duſt or pouder, <hi>broken</hi> is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to ſolid and hard, which yeeldeth with much a doe, of which ſort is euery mans hart by nature: hence are thoſe ſpeeches, <hi>a braſen fore-head, an yron ſinew. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The better to know what this contrite hart is, let vs firſt ſet downe what it is, 2 how it is gotten, 3 how it is tryed.</p>
            <p>A contrite hart is voyde of any conceit of the own worth, thinketh it ſelfe worthy of any puniſhment, and eſteemeth all it owne things moſt baſe, followeth the word of GOD into all formes, is comforted at the leaſt ſigne of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, caſt downe at the leaſt ſigne of his diſpleaſure, eaſily vpon iuſt occaſion is moued with affections of loue, feare, ioy, hope, &amp;c, is alwaies full of pitty to others, maketh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſmall things.</p>
            <p>It is gotten onely by the worke of the holy Ghoſt. Eze. 11, 19. Iohn 3, 6.</p>
            <p>The Spirit worketh without meanes, in infants, as in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1866:36"/>Iohn Baptiſt. By meanes of the word, 1 preparatorily by the Law, 2 effectingly by the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>The law prepareth, the Goſpell finiſheth, and worketh grace, as Nilus maketh Egipt fruitfull: heereupon it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>ministerie of the Spirit.</hi> 2, Cor, 2, 8.</p>
            <p>A helping cauſe to theſe, are, 1 priuitie to a mans ovvne ſinnes, infirmities, ſlippes: theſe keepe the hart the ſofter. 2 The croſſe ſanctified, as in Dauid, Ezechias.</p>
            <p>Now heere is breaking and contrition in two degrees: to teach vs how we are to proceed. Not to reſt in a little brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but to goe on to grinding.</p>
            <p>It is tried, for that 1 it chiefely medleth with it ſelfe ſtraitly, hath leyſure to looke to others, for it findeth it ſelfe ſo bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that all paines is too little to make it vp, as in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, the woman. Luke. 7.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It trembleth at the word of God, Eſay 66, 2, not onely at his workes, ſo did Elie, Dauid, Ioſiah, Ezechiah feare at the word.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Is patient vnder affliction.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Looketh not to outward things more then needs muſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Can abide no delay.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Cheereth vp it ſelfe onely in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Is not haſtie to vſe inordinate meanes, but hangeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon GOD.</p>

            <p>Ieruſalem, the chiefe cittie of Paleſtine. Firſt called Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Gene, 14, 18. Pſalm, 76.

            <p>A politicall ſtate, is a company of people well ordered &amp; furniſhed with things neceſſary for this preſent life.</p>

            <head>AN EXPOSITION vpon the tenne Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</head>
            <p>ALl mans happineſſe is in the knowledge of GOD. God maketh himſelfe knowne by his word: a part whereof is the morall Law, imprinted at the firſt in Adam and Eues hart: after, when that the light of it began to weare away, it was proclaimed to the world, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen in ſtone, kept for record in the Arke of the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, in opening and applying whereof, moſt of the Diuine Writers did ſpend their time: euen Chriſt himſelfe came to teach it, and doe it, and of it one iote or tittle cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly faile. It ſhall keepe the vſe that euer it had ſince the fall, to the generall reſurrection, and therefore is as needful now to be vnderſtood as at any time.</p>
            <p>It is commonly called <hi>the Decalogue,</hi> or tenne wordes or commaundements, for that there be tenne: <hi>the morall law,</hi> for that it ſetteth downe all duties for manners of mankind, of all ſorts and conditions, ſometimes <hi>the Law,</hi> for that it is the abſtract and abridgement of all lawes for humane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, meaning though the morall law, not law in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: &amp; is ſet downe in the 20 chapter of Exodus, from the beginning of the firſt verſe, to the end of the 17 verſe. In all thoſe verſes are two things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained, the one an entrance into the commaundements, the other, the treatiſe &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements themſelues. The entrance is in the two firſt verſes, for the more orderly ſetting down of the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and is likewiſe double: According to the

            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:39"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>This law which thou now hearest, is mine, the onely true God and</hi> Iehoua: <hi>therefore it is to be attended vnto, and obeyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There can be no doubt in any of this, and therfore God himſelfe, ſtandeth not further to proue it, but onely is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent barelie to ſet it downe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon is, from the diuers and great benefits, which God beſtowed vpon them, and may be thus framed. <hi>His law who hath bestowed most excellent benefits vppon you, ought to be attended vnto, and obeyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I, who deliuer this law, haue ſo done by you, therefore, &amp;c.</hi> Now what force benefits haue to preuaile with receiuers, for all obedience, becauſe it is cleere, God doth not further proue.</p>
            <p>It were enough for God to commaund, but to preuent with kindneſſe, would breake any good natured hart.</p>
            <p>Now the benefits which God beſtowed vpon them, are mentioned to be of two ſorts, generall, or more ſpeciall.</p>
            <p>Generall, is that which is the fountaine of all: viz. Gods couenaunt made with his people, and may be ſet out after this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I who haue taken you to be my people, and haue promiſed to be</hi> Iehoua <hi>your God, you must attend and obey my law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it is thus betweene you and me, therefore, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this benefit, another ſpeciall reaſon is implied, from the profeſſion of the people. For howſoeuer God coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunteth with his people, yet vnleſſe they againe couenant to take him for theyr God, it is not ſufficient, and therefore God meaneth this, that they couenaunting to take <hi>Iehoua</hi> for their God, muſt attend and obey his law.</p>
            <p>But ſo they haue done, therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And ſurely, there cannot be any ſo effectuall reaſons, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force all obedience to Gods law, as this. For taking God to be our God, we cannot but performe all fealtie vnto him: this profeſſion haue our parents made for vs, wee for our ſelues in ſacraments and prayers.</p>
            <p>More ſpeciall, are ſuch as by name are heere reckoned vp: and thoſe two, not but that God had beſtowed more
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1866:39"/>vpon them: but becauſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Theſe were very freſh in memory:</p>
            <p n="2">2 And in theſe GOD manifeſtly ſhewed himſelfe to be the true and theyr God, 1 by his wonderfull power in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and ſtrong workes, 2 by the conſtancie of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, vttered ſo long before, for their entring and going out of Egipt diuers hundreth of yeeres before, 3 by his vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull mercie and kindnes toward them, in ſo preſeruing, multiplying, and deliuering them.</p>
            <p n="3">3 They were in themſelues of ſpeciall excellencie and worth.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe is, <hi>bringing out of the Land of Egipt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Egipt</hi> in it ſelfe had many &amp; great commodities, but here it is conſidered, as giuen to idolatry, and euen of the vvorſt kind, to worſhip Crocodiles, Cats, yea Onyons and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, and moſt baſe creatures: ſo as that the Iſraelites could not liue among them with good conſcience, neither would the Egiptians ſuffer the Iſraelites (by theyr good wills) to worſhip God otherwiſe then themſelues did: ſo that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance from hence, muſt needes be a great fauour, where to haue doone as others, would bring no comfort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but hell for afterward, and to haue done otherwiſe, had brought certaine outward danger. VVell therefore doth God reckon vp this fauour, as to teach what an intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable thing it is to liue among idolaters, and what a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fauour to be deliuered from amongſt them: vvhere no meanes of ſaluation are, all ſinnes raigne, and where if one be once entrapped, it is moſt hard to winde out.</p>
            <p>No leſſe ſlauery then this were the Churches in, in Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Egypt, ſo as that deliuerance from thence, ought to preuaile alike. For ſurely the maſſe, images, reliques, bread, &amp;c. are as vile Idols as euer were among the Egyptians.</p>
            <p>The ſame may be ſaide for all ſuch as are vnregenerate, that theyr ſlauery is very great.</p>
            <p>The ſecond benefit is, <hi>bringing out of the houſe of bondage,</hi> or <hi>ſeruaunts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as the former is ſpirituall, this is bodily, implying
<pb facs="tcp:1866:40"/>muſt a man haue God, and then worſhip him: ſecondlie, for that it is impoſſible that a man ſhould well vnderſtand the other without this.</p>
            <p>It is called <hi>great,</hi> for that the true vnderſtanding and vſe thereof, is of great importance, as alſo for that it is one of the hardeſt to be kept, and ſtretcheth very far.</p>

               <p>And theſe words <hi>to thee,</hi> is not onely to thy ſelfe, but to any of thine, or any by thy meanes or occaſion, whom thou maiſt lawfully hinder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Other Gods.</hi> It may be as well read God as Gods. For though the word in Hebrew be of the plurall number, yet it ſignifieth ſingulerly, and one: and beſides, one worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping but any other ſtrange God, though hee worſhip not many, breaketh this law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Other,</hi> that is, beſides or with the true <hi>Iehoua,</hi> who I am, and thoſe whoſoeuer they be, are not Gods, but ſo called, as ſaith Paule, <hi>though there be that are called Gods, whether in heauen or in earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1, Cor, 8, 5,</note> 
                  <hi>as there be many Gods, and many Lords, yet vnto vs there is but one God.</hi> And therefore this name God, is giuen to them, according to the faſhion and manner of ſpeech in the world. Of this kind were there ſundry in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, as Cats, Crocodiles, &amp;c, and other in other nations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Before me.</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>before my face,</hi> which manner of ſpeech is often in the Scriptures, taken from men, and giuen to God. Now in the face are the eyes, which in men are meanes of knowledge, ſo as that the face in this ſence, ſundry times is vſed of God, for his knowledge, as Gene, 6, 11. Gene, 10, 9, <hi>before GOD,</hi> or <hi>his face,</hi> that is, in his knowledge. Now likewiſe becauſe Gods knowledge is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where, looke pſalme 139, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, in vvhich
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1866:40"/>reſpect, ſundry learned men haue ſaid, God is all eye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knoweth all things: therefore Gods meaning is, that they ſhould not haue any other God at all, ſo as he may know, and nothing can they doe but hee will know, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt they haue none other. Theſe are the words.</p>
               <p>The meaning is in the matter contained, the ſum where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is this: <hi>Thou must haue me to be thy GOD, and none other.</hi> And heere are two parts, the one affirming what we ought to doe, the other denying, and forbidding. The affirming is, <hi>thou must haue me to be thy God,</hi> the which is more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet downe, Deut: 6, 5, Ioſh: 24, 15, Math: 4, 10. Now this giueth vs to conſider of <hi>perſons,</hi> and <hi>dutie.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Perſons,</hi> who is to haue, and whom to haue.</p>
               <p>Who is to haue, <hi>thou,</hi> that is, no partie in the world, of whom, or to whom it may be ſaid thou, as before.</p>
               <p>The <hi>perſon</hi> whom wee are to haue, is ſet downe in this word <hi>me,</hi> who is heere the ſpeaker, and ſetteth out himſelfe verſe 2, and muſt be conſidered as he ſetteth himſelfe out in the Scriptures, one God, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt: eternall, omnipotent, infinite, moſt iuſt, moſt mercifull, &amp; maker of heauen and earth. Looke Exod: 34, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>This God muſt be vnderſtood alone, as Marke 12, 29. Deut: 6, 4, Math, 4, 10. Ioſh: 24, 9.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid, that in the 2 of the Kings, chapter 17 verſe 33, the <hi>people feared the Lord, but ſerued their gods after the manner of the nations whom they carried thence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Aunſwer. The Author doth not report, that the people ſo dooing did well, but hee onely ſheweth what they did, meaning indeed to declare how wickedly therein they did: and therefore Zephany 1, 5, God threatneth to cut off the remnant of them that worſhip and ſweare by the Lord, and ſweare by Malcham, that is, giue any reſpect vnto any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: neither indeed can there be any fellowſhip betweene Chriſt and Belial. 2, Cor: 6, 15.</p>
               <p>The <hi>dutie</hi> is, to haue this <hi>Iehoua</hi> the true GOD, for our God. This hauing, meaneth more then it ſoundeth: In the world a man may haue that which he doth not regard nor vſe,

               <p>But heere we muſt be warie. For it is not ſimply forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to carue or graue, then the Tabernacle had not beene ſo curiouſly wrought, nor Salomons Temple, but this is to be vnderſtood in Gods meaning, &amp; as the faſhion of ſome was to vſe grauen images, to repreſent the true God by, or to worſhip him in them, or by occaſion of them: the which is heere forbidden, and no otherwiſe: ſo as when he ſaith no grauen image, he meaneth, to ſet out GOD, or worſhip God thereby, otherwiſe it is lawfull to graue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Similitude,</hi> is likenes, which is heere ſet out, by the things the like whereof is forbidden.</p>
               <p>Similitude is put for any repreſentation, either for the thing it ſelfe, or the repreſenting of it, by painting, embro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, printing, yea for the likenes of it imagined in the minde, namely, to repreſent God, or worſhip him by it, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it is not forbidden.</p>
               <p>The things whereof the likeneſſe is forbidden, are <hi>in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen aboue, earth beneath, the waters vnder the earth,</hi> that is indeede, of any creature, for in theſe places are all creatures, the heauens ſignifying the ayre, as well as the ſtarrie skie, ſo that birds, and ſuch like are meant.</p>
               <p>Yea the manhoode of our Lord Ieſus Chriſts, and the Angels are meant. Whereby it may appeare, that the holy Ghoſt in likeneſſe of a Doue, nor the auncient of daies like an old man, ſhould be portreyed vnto vs.</p>
               <p>The ſecond degree is, for not worſhipping theſe, &amp; that in two branches, the firſt, <hi>not to bow downe to them,</hi> the other, <hi>not to ſerue them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>to bow,</hi> is of geſture, and (as I take it) ſignifieth to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1866:41"/>fall downe groueling, in token of honour, and is put for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outward ſigne of bowing the knee or body, vncouering the head, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The other of ſeruing, is by no outward deede, of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our ſelues for them, ſpeaking in honour of them, kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, or any ſuch like, to ſhew the leaſt good reſpect of them.</p>
               <p>So as that now it may appeare, the ſtrange manner of woſhipping of God is forbidden vnder one ſpeciall kinde, and the pure manner implyed thereby.</p>
               <p>This ſtrange manner is forbidden vnder the name of grauen image, and likeneſſe of other things: 1 becauſe that in theſe, men did moſt offend: 2 and to theſe, our nature moſt carrieth vs, as we ſee in the Iſraelites who would haue a likeneſſe: 3 and beſides, the Egyptians Temples vvere painted full of ſuch likeneſſes.</p>
               <p>It would be too long to ſet downe, both ſtrange &amp; pure worſhip: the pure ſhall ſerue, whereby wee may iudge of the other.</p>
               <p>It is agreed by all, that there is ſome ſtraight rule of the pure worſhip of GOD, whereto it muſt be framed, from whence if it ſwarue, it cannot pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>The rule of Gods pure worſhip, is his owne voyce, will, word, Eſay 29, 13. Coloſ. 2, 22. and that written and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in the Bible, &amp; Canonicall bookes thereof: ſo as that whatſoeuer ſhall not haue warrant there-from, is not to be admitted.</p>
               <p>So as that all heatheniſh Idols, all Iewiſh ceremonies ſince Chriſtes comming, muſt be remoued: yea all Romiſh pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, croſſes, bleſſings, pilgrimages, reliques, ſingings, and ſuch like, not grounded on the word, muſt away.</p>
               <p>All that the word teacheth for the pure manner of Gods worſhip, is either for the parts, or the properties of it.</p>
               <p>The parts are, whereof the whole worſhip of God dooth conſiſt. And they be either more principall, or leſſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall.</p>
               <p>Principall are ſuch as cannot be left vnperformed: as is the
<pb facs="tcp:1866:42"/> Iealous, is one who is grieued for ſuſpition of diſhoneſtie in his married yoake-fellow, husband, or wife.</p>
               <p>This ſome Interpreters thinke to be in GOD, as diuers times the word is ſo tranſlated by them, and that by occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mariage band betweene God and his Church, &amp; likewiſe the force of iealouſie whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it doth reuenge. Which ſeemeth ſometimes to be in God.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe (be it with reuerence to all that thinke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, with willingneſſe to be reformed if I erre) I think it is not ſo heere to be taken.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Iealous, and zealous, are not alwaies both, this word heere ſignifieth both.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Iealouſie is a fault, and not to be aſcribed to God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Some very learned men, as <hi>Tremelius</hi> and <hi>Iunius,</hi> take it for zealous.</p>
               <p n="4">4 It muſt be that heere, from whence commeth viſiting the iniquitie of the fathers, &amp;c. and ſhewing mercie, nowe iealouſie neuer ſheweth mercie.</p>
               <p>I read it therefore a zealous God, that is, a God full of zeale, as <hi>Simon</hi> was called <hi>zelotes,</hi> or zelous.</p>
               <p>Zeale is a moſt earneſt affection, or the great increaſe of any affection, loue, anger, hatred: ſo as we heard before of Gods power, now we heare of his will, whereby he is moſt earneſt to performe whatſoeuer pleaſeth himſelfe. Ioel. 2, 18.</p>
               <p>So as that in this zeale is, 1 preſentneſſe, that is, God now at this inſtant is zealous: 2 is earneſtneſſe, 3 is continuance, as a burning.</p>
               <p>Now he that is ſuch a God, had neede be obeyed. God commaunding this, is ſo: therefore he muſt be obeyed.</p>
               <p>For that ſome might doubt whether God be ſo, yea or no, God himſelfe proueth that by his zealous iuſtice, and zealous mercie.</p>
               <p>His iuſtice, in that hee ſaith, <hi>viſiting the iniquitie of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon the children, vppon the third generation, and vppon the fourth, of them that hate me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherein we may conſider what he doth, &amp; to whom.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:1866:42"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>He reſiteth the iniquitie of the fathers.</hi> Wherein is the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the obiect. Action, <hi>viſiting.</hi> Obiect, <hi>iniquitie.</hi> Set out by the ſubiect <hi>of the fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Viſiting,</hi> commeth of a Latine word to viſite: to viſite, is often to come to ſee, to take knowledge, and to iudge and doe thereafter, in which ſence wee vſe viſitation. So doth God proceede. Gene, 11, 5, Gene, 18, 21.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe when God ſo commeth and findeth men faultie, he is wont to puniſh, therfore is viſiting ſometimes put for puniſhing, as pſalm, 89, 32. <hi>I will viſit their iniquitie with the rod, and theyr ſinnes with ſcourges.</hi> And of Dathan and Abiram. <hi>If theſe men be viſited after the viſitation,</hi> that is, <hi>the puniſhment of all men.</hi> Num: 16, 29. VVhereupon ſome tranſlate it heere, rendring, or repaying.</p>
               <p>The obiect is <hi>iniquitie,</hi> that is ſinne, or breach of the law of God, and more ſpecially breach of this law: the which God neuer leaueth vnpuniſhed.</p>
               <p>This iniquitie is further ſet out by the ſubiect in whom it is ſaid to be, that is, <hi>fathers</hi> and <hi>ancetors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much what God doth, now followeth to whom, <hi>vpon the chyldren,</hi> or <hi>ſonnes, vpon the third and fourth genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Where we may ſee, vpon whom, and how many.</p>
               <p>He doth thus to the ſonnes and poſteritie.</p>
               <p>Que. Doe children beare the puniſhment of theyr Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſinnes?</p>
               <p>Aun. Yea, of ſome, as of the firſt ſin of our firſt parents Adam and Eue, and likewiſe of ſuch actuall ſinnes as our fathers haue taught vs to practiſe, otherwiſe not. For better vnderſtanding whereof know, that in ſin we may conſider the fault againſt God, and the puniſhment, whereby God is wont to ſhew his diſpleaſure. Whereſoeuer the fault is, the puniſhment is deſerued.</p>
               <p>Puniſhments are ſpirituall, or temporall, and of this life.</p>
               <p>Spirituall, hindering one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euerlaſting ſaluation: theſe doth neuer God bring vppon any, but for his owne fault: and therefore originall corruption, is partly our own fault, becauſe we are part of Adam.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:43"/>
               <p> Of this lfie are ſuch as doe not hinder a mans ſaluation, and befall the godly and wicked both alike, and are to the godly many times profitable.</p>
               <p>Now indeede ſometimes by occaſion of others, the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feele ſome outward ſmart, but ſtill with Gods loue, ſo as ſuch ſufferings, are no puniſhments, but exerciſes and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and therefore God neuer puniſheth in anger other mens ſinnes in vs, but ſuch as we haue and learne from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>Now for that idolatry is learned by parents for the moſt part, therefore God ſheweth, that the dutie which children owe to their parents, ſhall not excuſe them if they learne idolatrie and falſe worſhip of God from theyr fathers.</p>
               <p>Now all this while, no certaine puniſhment is named, that the offenders might feare all, neither is time mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that euer puniſhment might be looked for.</p>
               <p>How many this puniſhment concerneth, is <hi>vpon the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where firſt we muſt remember, that this doth not ſtretch (as partly we ſaw before) but to ſuch as hate GOD, that is who breake this commaundement: ſo as that wee may ſee, all breakers of Gods commaundements, in ſome ſort doe hate God, vnder what pretence ſoeuer it be.</p>
               <p>And that it reacheth <hi>to the third &amp; fourth generation,</hi> that is I take it, to any that doe breake this commaundement, ſome named for all: thus wee ſee how God deſtroyed the Canaanites, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This manner of ſpeech is vſed, 1 to teach vs, that this kinde of ſin is often conueied, by parents to children.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That parents ſhould be carefull to inſtruct theyr chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the pure worſhip of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That children, if they meane to be free from Gods pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, ſhould eſpecially ſeeke from their parents, to learne to worſhip God purely.</p>
               <p>So as that it is much for the worſhipping of God of what parents one commeth: and heere wee may learne to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the Papiſts, what we ſhould thinke of their ancetors and ours, who died in Papiſtrie. For wee ſee that three or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1866:43"/>foure generations may hate God.</p>
               <p>Thus much for Gods zeale in his iuſtice, now followeth his zeale in his mercy, <hi>ſhewing mercy to thouſands that loue me, and keepe my commaundements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where we may ſee what he doth, and to whom.</p>
               <p>He <hi>ſheweth mercy,</hi> that is, forgiueth their ſinnes, beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſundry fauours of this life, and of that which is to come, as in Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, Dauid, not for their vvorkes, but as the word is, for his mercie.</p>
               <p>But ſome may ſay, how is this true, ſeeing that many ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters floriſh? and true worſhippers of God are puniſhed?</p>
               <p>Though Idolaters ſcape heere, they are puniſhed heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and though the godly heere are vnder the croſſe, yet are they in Gods fauour, and ſhall enioy him for euer after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>Thus much for this ſecond commaundement, and the manner of worſhipping the true God.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Gods Name is himſelfe, &amp; he is his Name, ſo often haue we in the ſcriptures, <hi>hallowed be thy Name,</hi> that is thy ſelfe, <hi>call vpon the Name of the Lord,</hi> that is himſelfe.

I take it that artificiall day is here meant: and though the Iewes did count their Sabbath from euening to euening, yet it vvas but as they counted theyr other naturall dayes, not to be vp and wake all the night, no more then theyr bodyes vvill beare. And becauſe ſome bodily reſt is neceſſary, &amp; alowed,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1866:45"/>therefore though the night belong to the day, to make it whole naturall, yet I iudge it was no more to be kept holy then the working dayes working: ſo as that day, is the light, and ſo much of the night as may be ſpared without hurting the body.</p>
               <p>This day ſignifieth it ſelfe wholy, and euery houre and euen minute thereof, as the creature without hurt to it ſelfe and other can performe.</p>
               <p>But this day is not euery, but the <hi>ſabbath. Sabbath</hi> of it ſelfe dooth ſignifie reſt, or time of reſt. Heere it is put for a day ſpecially ſet a part for reſt, as the particle <hi>ha</hi> in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, and the <hi>affixe</hi> ſheweth.</p>
               <p>Among the Iewes were ſundry ſuch times, as of yeeres, of weekes, of dayes, all which they were to keepe. Alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their daies, ſome did not ſo often returne, ſome did returne in euery ſeauen daies, which day dooth manifeſtlie appeare to be meant heere, as by repeating of the dayes of creation, the dayes of worke, &amp;c. is manifeſt. This is the obiect, the act followeth: <hi>keepe it holy,</hi> in one word ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it, both are one.</p>
               <p>To ſanctifie or halow, doth ſignifie diuerſly. 1 To make a thing holy, by putting holineſſe into it morallie.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To acknowledge a thing holy. 3 To appoint a thing to holy, religious, honeſt vſes. 4 To vſe thinges to thoſe good vſes wherefore they are appointed.</p>
               <p>This day hath no more holines in it ſelfe then any other, that for it ſelfe it might be counted more holy then other, onely God hath appointed it to holy vſes aboue others, and would haue vs vſe it thereunto.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the further deelaration of this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. verſe, 9, 10, 11, and that by way of expoſition, or confirmation. By expoſition, verſe, 9, 10. Wherein God himſelfe ſheweth his meaning in the commaundement. Where becauſe mention was made of a day, and keeping holy, he ſheweth what day he meaneth, and what by kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping holy. Day, is the ſeauenth after ſixe, wherin they may (and vnleſſe iuſt cauſe hinder) they muſt worke.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:46"/>
               <p>ties be of charitie and kindneſſe to man, or beaſt, or other creatures, and can neither be well done, before, or after.</p>
               <p>Now then, if worke be forbidden, much more ieſt, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſinning.</p>
               <p>There are forbidden a mans owne ſelfe, or any other by his authoritie, or ſuffering.</p>
               <p>Ones wife is not named, becauſe ſhee is preſumed to be himſelfe, that whatſoeuer is forbidden him, muſt be known to be forbidden her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sonne, or daughter,</hi> none to whom wee carrie moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection, and ſo might winke at them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Man ſeruaunt, or maide,</hi> whom thou mighteſt haue vſe for to ſet about buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beast,</hi> eſpecially the labouring beaſt, as oxe, aſſe, horſe.</p>
               <p>Que. Hath God care ouer beaſts?</p>
               <p>Aun. Yea, for mens ſake, leaſt men by tending the beaſt in their labour, might be occaſioned to breake the ſabbath. Whereuppon wee muſt know, that not onely beaſts, but whatſoeuer may neede mans help, as mill, boat, &amp;c. ſhould ſtay.</p>
               <p>Some exception muſt be made, in regard of warre, or a long voiage vpon the ſea, or riding poſt for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths great good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stranger,</hi> properly, Proſelite, one who is wone to the Iewiſh religion, others are not ſo to be vrged.</p>
               <p>Marke that any ouer others, are to cauſe all theyrs to keepe holy this day.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the expoſition of the commandement, the confirmation followeth. Wherein are reaſons to inforce to the obedience thereof: the firſt whereof is, God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth but one of ſeauen, therefore good reaſon is it that wee ſhould obey.</p>
               <p n="2">2 God requireth no more then that which himſelfe hath done, therefore ought men to doe ſo. GOD reſteth from creating, not from gouerning: from making new kindes, not ſinguler things.</p>
               <p n="3">3 GOD hath bleſſed and halowed this day to this end,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1866:46"/>therefore it muſt be kept.</p>
               <p>Thus haue wee the commaundement ſhortly laid open, but all this while heere is nothing of the place.</p>
               <p>The place of Gods worſhip is euery where, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, the publique muſt be in publique place, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was tied to the Arke, and was flitting at this time when the Law was giuen, is not mentioned, yet was it ſet ſo, as whoſoeuer ſhould publiquely worſhip God elſwhere then there, did offend. Such places were the Tabernacle, the Temple of Ieruſalem, the Sinagogue. We haue Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>But indeede this muſt be remembred, none is tied ſo to any place, as the Iewes were to Ieruſalem, becauſe the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there, was a type of Chriſt, without who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing could pleaſe God: and yet againe worſhip as in time, muſt be in place.</p>
               <p>So as that in time of publique, pure, and ſound worſhip of GOD, publique places muſt be reſorted vnto, neither muſt men tary at home, or haunt corners.</p>
               <p>But put caſe ſome notorious ſinners reſort thether, ought not I then to forbeare?</p>
               <p>Aun. No, other mens ſinnes, if I conſent not to them, ſhall not hurt me.</p>
               <p>It may further be demaunded, whether a man be tyed to his owne Pariſh?</p>
               <p>Aun. Indeede pariſhes were diſtinguiſhed by men, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe not to be neglected, when conueniently for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of place one may reſort vnto them, and there be in them ſufficient meanes to ſaluation, and no other iuſt cauſe reſtrayning.</p>
               <p>So then publique time muſt likewiſe haue publique pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in eſtabliſhed, and peaceable Churches.</p>
               <p>By all this hetherto we may perceiue, Gods meaning is to haue all publique duties of his worſhip, to be performed in due ſort.</p>
               <p>All duties belonging to the Sabbath, are either before it, or on it. Duties before it are:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb facs="tcp:1866:47"/> 1 To deſire the Sabbath, for the duties of the Sabbath. Eſay, 58, 13, 14, and therefore Amos blameth thoſe, who wiſh the Sabbath gone, that they may ſet forth corne, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Diſpatch of all buſineſſe (as much as in vs lieth) that neither the reſt, nor holineſſe of the Sabbath be hindered. Exod. 16, 23, 29. Iohn, 19, 31.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That the weeke dayes duties do not drown our minds, but that we may freely, and cheerefully attend the worſhip of God. This ſhall we doe:
<list>
                     <item>1 Vſing the world, as not abuſing it. 1, Cor, 7, 31.</item>
                     <item>2 Taking heed of grieuous ſinnes which harden the hart.</item>
                     <item>3 Hauing daily exerciſe in the word, and prayer.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>On the day are ſundry duties, which before I name this muſt be remembred, that,</p>
               <p n="1">1 All Iewiſh ſuperſtition muſt be remoued. The Iewes will not roaſt an apple, peele an onyon, kill a flea, ſnuffe a candle on this day, but hire others to doe thus for them.</p>
               <p>It may be demaunded what ſhould be thought of him who gathered ſticks. Num. 15, 32.</p>
               <p>Anſw. Though the thing ſeeme ſmall, it was very great, beeing done vppon contempt.</p>
               <p>Que. But what for making fire?</p>
               <p>Aun. That none which hindereth the ſanctification of this day, ſhould be made.</p>
               <p n="2">2 We muſt not iudge this commaundement as ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, beeing before the fall. Gene, 2, 2, 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Wee muſt haue more care of the ſanctification of this day, then the bodily reſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4 This day is as much to be ſpent in the duties of Gods worſhip, as other dayes in our owne workes: the manner of ſpeech for both, is all one: 2 worſhipping of GOD is more neceſſarie: 3 the time ſhorter.</p>
               <p>Now then the duties vpon this day may be conſidered, as they are of preparation to duties, or practiſe of duties.</p>
               <p>Helping to preparation is, 1 riſing early in the morning, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſober and graue attire, not crauing too much time in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on, or making too gay ſhew: 3 moderate eating and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1866:47"/>drinking.</p>
               <p>The preparation it ſelfe is, as to the beginning of this law.</p>
               <p>The practiſe of duties, is according to the kinds of duties.</p>
               <p>Some duties are publique, others priuate.</p>
               <p>Publique duties are ſuch as muſt be performed by the whole great aſſembly, in the common place for Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Whereof we may conſider the properties, and the number.</p>
               <p>They muſt be 1 ioyntly of all together, ſo as that in one voice: all the eares &amp; harts preſent are to attend. So as that in publique, none muſt haue his priuate deuotions, otherwiſe then the aſſembly.</p>
               <p n="2">2 They muſt be from the beginning to the end, men muſt not come ſlackly after beginning, nor depart till the end, and that aſſembly be diſcharged.</p>
               <p n="3">3 There muſt be all ſilence and attention.</p>
               <p>The publique duties themſelues are: 1 of the word of God read and preached.</p>
               <p>The word read is the Canonicall ſcriptures by peece-meale recited, ſo as that (if it were poſſible) in a yere of ſuch competent time, they might all be paſſed thorough.</p>
               <p>The word preached, is the ſcriptures plainly opened and applied, to the neceſſary vſes of the hearers vnto ſaluation. This all that we may, we muſt procure.</p>
               <p>He that meaneth to profit by the word preached, 1 muſt bring a teachable minde, 2 muſt pray for a bleſſing vppon himſelfe: 3 muſt diligently marke the heads &amp; proofes: 4 exerciſe himſelfe in it afterward.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Making of prayer, and giuing of thanks to God in the name of Chriſt, in faith, in loue, in feeling of our wants, not onely for our ſelues, but others, with endeuour in meanes.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Celebrating ſacraments, not onely partaking the Lords Supper, but beeing preſent at Baptiſme, conſidering our ſelues in the preſent infant, examining our ſelues whether we finde the fruite of our Baptiſme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ea or no.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Gathering, that is, laying a ſide ſomwhat for the poore. 1, Cor, 16, 1.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:48"/>
               <p>can fully be performed, ſo as that likewiſe all other muſt be doone in it.</p>
               <p>The meaſure is, <hi>as thy ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt remember loue is ordinate, or inordinate. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate is, which neither hath iuſt cauſe to moue it, nor due meaſure in it.</p>
               <p>Ordinate is, which hath both: this onely is vnderſtood, ſo as louing our ſelues well, wee muſt loue other folkes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>But it may be demaunded, is there no difference, between good loue of my ſelfe, and others?</p>
               <p>Aun. Both muſt be ſincere, earneſt, working, perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, wiſe. But I begin with my ſelfe, and things being alike, I loue my ſelfe in greater meaſure.</p>
               <p>Hetherto the ſumme of the ſecond table, which Chriſt commendeth, in that hee ſaith it is like to the other: 1 hard to be kept, 2 neceſſary, 3 profitable: wherupon &amp; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the Law and the Prophets doe depend: that is, are chiefly ſpent in ſetting downe the duties contained therein.</p>
               <p>The commaundements themſelues of the ſecond Table follow, requiring all duties of all ſorts to men, and theſe are of practiſe and act, or of motion, and firſt thought.</p>
               <p>Practiſe or act, ſignifieth ſuch as are with conſent, and theſe are, verſe 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. whereof as the perſons to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whom they muſt be practiſed are diuers, ſo are the kinds.</p>
               <p>The perſons are ſuperiors, or betters, and others.</p>
               <p>Duties in reſpect of betters are commaunded, verſe 12. before the reſt, to ſhew that publique muſt be preferred before priuate.</p>
               <p>The commaundement requiring theſe duties, is the firſt with promiſe, Ephe. 6, 2, ſhewing ſome ſpeciall regard that ought to be had thereof.</p>
               <p>One may doubt howe this ſhould be true, ſince all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, if they be kept, haue promiſe of life, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, ſeeing the ſecond commaundement likewiſe hath promiſe of mercie to thouſands. &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:1866:48"/>
               <p> But we are to aunſwere, that Paule in calling it the firſt, he meaneth the firſt of the ſecond table, and the firſt which hath particuler promiſe: the commaundements all, and ſo the ſecond, haue a generall and indefinite promiſe.</p>
               <p>This commaundement chargeth to honour Parents, and forbiddeth the contrary. It hath two parts, the dutie, the promiſe.</p>
               <p>The dutie is, <hi>honour thy father, and thy mother.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the reſt. The dutie ſetteth out the parties, and the thing.</p>
               <p>The parties honouring, to be honoured. The partie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring, or who is to honour, <hi>thou,</hi> that is euery one, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, noble as well as others, great men as well as others. So did Salomon honour his mother though hee were a King, 1, Kings, 2, 19. ſo did Ioſeph his parents, hee beeing a great Prince. This muſt be thought of for all practiſes of honor.</p>
               <p>The parties to be honoured, <hi>father &amp; mother.</hi> Who ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie all other ſuperiors whatſoeuer: whom God thus cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, to teach all ſuperiors to be affected to theyr inferiors, as parents to children, in which meaning, the Romans called their chiefe men fathers: and withall, to teach inferiors in what kindneſſe they are to performe dutie, to wit, as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren doe to Parents.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt forbiddeth, Math, 23, 9, to call any man Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Aunſ. Chriſtes ſpeech muſt be taken in his owne mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Hee meaneth heere, father in that ſence it was vſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Phariſees, and ſuch as would be counted learned: So elſe where dooth Chriſt ſpeake, fitting himſelfe to the conceits of his hearers, as Iohn, 5, 31, <hi>If I ſhould beare witnes of my ſelfe, my witneſſe were not true.</hi> That is, if I were as you ſuppoſe mee to be. So likewiſe, Iohn 7, 16, <hi>My doctrine is not mine,</hi> that is, as you take me to be a meere man, &amp;c. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame ſort forbiddeth he to call father.</p>
               <p>The Iewes and Phariſees vſed this as a ſwelling title, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to be called in Hebrew, <hi>Abothemi,</hi> that is, our Fathers: as the holy Father the Pope, ſo the Romiſh prieſts are
<pb facs="tcp:1866:49"/>Prince. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Then may ſuperiors looke for all duties with a good hart, when themſelues performe theirs.</p>
               <p>Firſt among all are naturall parents. Their duties are ioyntly,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Before euer they haue children, to endeauour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be in the couenaunt of God, that their chyldren ſo may be, elſe are they butchers of their children, before they be breeders; out of Gods couenant, better not to be. Other parents, one calleth, <hi>parents of dirt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Parents are in the couenaunt, when they belieue in Chriſt and are baptiſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2 They muſt mary in the Lord. Children in whoredome are branded with perpetuall infamie.</p>
               <p>Thoſe marry in the Lord, when both profeſſing true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, haue parents conſent, and holily doe conſumate &amp; ſolemnize mariage, wherein the children are begotten.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Such children as God ſhall giue, they muſt conſecrate to the Lord, as Hanna did Samuell, &amp; it is like, Eunica did Timotheus. Eſpecially God required the firſt borne.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Aſloone as may be conueniently, they muſt procure them to be baptiſed, in the preſence of faithfull witneſſes. Eſay, 8, 2.</p>
               <p n="5">5 All their life long, they muſt giue their children good example.</p>
               <p>As their childrens yeeres will beare, they muſt bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp in nurture, and inſtruction of the Lord. Ephe, 6, 3.</p>
               <p>And firſt acquaint them with the grounds of truth, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſaluation, 1 at home: 2 bringing them to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique aſſemblies: 3 looking that they behaue themſelues well there.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as ſoone as may be to breake them of theyr corrupt deſires. The neglect of this, marred Ophni and Phineas, Elies ſonnes, Adoniah &amp; Abſolon, Dauids ſonnes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to invre them to doe things, rather for to pleaſe God, then for flattering, or gifts.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they muſt not make them too gay in coates,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1866:49"/>but allow them conuenient diet and attire.</p>
               <p>Fiftly at leaſt let them learne to write and read.</p>
               <p n="7">7 They muſt pray for their children.</p>
               <p n="8">8 They muſt obſerue their childrens diſpoſitions and gifts, and thereafter prepare them to ſuch a kind of life and calling, as they ſhall be fitteſt for Gods glory, &amp; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, taking heede of idleneſſe, and euill companie.</p>
               <p n="9">9 They muſt haue a care in due time to prouide meete mariages for them.</p>
               <p>In dooing all theſe, as the fathers gifts are commonly the greater, ſo the greater muſt his endeuour be.</p>
               <p>But in any caſe this muſt be looked vnto, that the parents be not deuided, that that one doth, both muſt doe, one muſt not cocker againſt the other: one neuer mar what the other maketh. This is a common fault this way.</p>
               <p>The mother ſhe hath her peculiar: 1 to nurſe her owne child if well ſhe may, otherwiſe, to get a godly, wholſome and carefull nurſe: 2 to teach it at home in the tender yeres, 3 to looke to the cleanlineſſe and handſomneſſe of it.</p>
               <p>All theſe ſame things ſhould others doe, who are in the place of naturall parents.</p>
               <p>Parents by ſpirituall office, follow father and mother.</p>
               <p>Father as before, ſo was Paule to the Corinthians, 1, 4, 5, to Timotheus, 1, 1, 2, to Titus, 1, 3, to Philemon, 19.</p>
               <p>Such an one is hee who is ſet ouer vs in the Lord, enabled with gifts, endeuouring the ſauing of ſoules. Whoſe labors if God bleſſe, he is more then a father. By fathers we be, by ſuch we bleſſedly ſhall be, though it be GOD who is the chiefe worker. Thus was Elias to Elizeus, Elizeus to king Ioas.</p>
               <p>One who endeauoureth this way, muſt be in ſauing doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, deliuering it eaſily to be vnderſtood, as particularlie as may be, beſides prayer, and continuance in all.</p>
               <p>Mother is the Church, Gala, 4, 26, out of the which there is no ſaluation: ſo that hee hath not God his father, vvho hath not the Church his mother. This is the Catholique Apoſtolique Church, built vppon the Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</p>

               <p> Aunſw. Before I doe it, I muſt out of the word of God be perſwaded of the lawfulneſſe of it, and not doe it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, then is it ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2 I muſt take heede of giuing ſcandall.</p>
               <p>But what if ſearching to finde out the nature of the thing commaunded, I cannot finde it out in the particuler, as my Prince commaunding mee to aſſiſt the diſtreſſed King of Portugall, I ſee no further into it.</p>
               <p>Aun. I thinke I not onely may, but ſhould be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the lawfulneſſe of it. In this caſe I take it rather to be the Commaunders fault, if there be any, then the obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>The kinde of the thing heere mentioned, is <hi>honor,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all manner of due reſpect, euery way in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
               <p>Honour conteineth all other duties in it, and is if wee ſhould ſpeake as it is, praiſe-much increaſed and enlarged, declared by all other tokens.</p>
               <p>In this place, according to the ſundry parties to whom it belongeth, it is diuers to all &amp; euerie, it is as much as is due. We may conſider of it as generall, or ſpeciall.</p>
               <p>Generall, wee may call that which belongeth to all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and this is manifold.</p>
               <p n="1">1 To iudge that they ought to be honoured, for that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie God hath put vpon them. Rom, 1, 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To iudge them better then our ſelues in that behalfe. Phil. 2.3. Rom, 12, 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Purpoſe to ſhew them honour in all things.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Commendable ſhamefaſtneſſe in their preſence. Iob, 29, 20, 21, 22, which ariſeth from the conſcience of our owne vnworthineſſe, in compariſon of thoſe who are our betters.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Care in all things to hide their infirmities. Gene, 9, 22, 23, 24. We ſee how that diſpleaſed God.</p>
               <p>Infirmities ſhould neither make vs ſhew leſſe honor, nor procure vs to tell them to others.</p>
               <p n="6">6 We muſt pray for them, and giue thankes, 1, Tim. 2, 2.</p>

Leuiticus, 19, 32. 2 to be vncouered: 3 to be ſilent and forbeare noiſe: 4 to giue honourable titles.</p>
               <p>But what meaneth that, Iob. 32, 22. <hi>I may not giue titles, least my Maker ſhould take me away ſuddainly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Aun. It is meant of flattering and gloſing titles. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mark how Sarah called her husband Lord, Elizeus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias father, Ioas Elizeus, and ſuch like: therefore were the children torne in peeces by Beares for calling bald-head.</p>
               <p n="5">5 We muſt preuent their good deſires as farre as we may know them, and not ſtay to ſhewe dutie till it be demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Countenaunce, geſture, gate, attire, &amp;c, muſt be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Speciall followeth, and is particular, or proper.</p>
               <p>Particuler, which agreeth to ſome, but not to euery kind and partie. Therefore to naturall parents, gardians, magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, maiſters, paſtors.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Care to pleaſe euen the froward: 2 obedience to theyr commaundements: 3 to haue a care as wel what they think of vs, as what they doe to vs: 4 to yeelde to their correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without aunſwering againe: 5 to relieue them in their wants. Chriſt blameth ſuch, who vnder pretence to giue to the offerings of God, gaue not to their parents: it is true of others.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Not to diſpoſe of our ſelues in mariage, without due reſpect of euery of them, as the word of God requireth: 7 when we are out of their iuriſdiction, to keepe an honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conceipt and affection to them. So did Heſter 2, 20.</p>
               <p>Proper honour remaineth, which belongeth to ſome one kinde.</p>
               <p>And firſt to the naturall parents belongeth the common and particuler honour in greater meaſure, ſo as not onely he that ſtriketh his father, Exod, 21, 15, but alſo hee vvho
<pb facs="tcp:1866:51"/>curſeth his father ſhould die, Exod, 21, 17. Looke Prou. 30, 17.</p>
               <p>The Mother bare, the father and ſhee brought vp, beare their infirmities, relieue theyr wants more then others.</p>
               <p>To the ſpirituall father, 1, Theſſ. 5, 13, to haue them in ſinguler loue for theyr workes ſake. Yea, Gala, 4, 15, that they would haue beene contented to plucke out their own eyes. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This is called 1, Tim, 5, 17, double honour, which <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſostome</hi> vnderſtandeth for reuerence and things neceſſarie for life.</p>
               <p>I thinke wee ſhould not be curious about the number. Double ſignifieth much, and great honour: ſo the Spirit doubled, or a double portion, 2, Kings, 2, 9, ſignifieth very much, as the firſt borne was to haue a double portion.</p>
               <p>All this honour is, that the Paſtor may with more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie preach the word, and that the people with more fruite might heare it.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that the ſpirituall father may be without feare. 1, Cor, 16, 10. which is to be deliuered from vnreaſonable and captious men.</p>
               <p>Second, that hee who is taught in the word, make him who taught him, partaker of all his goods, Gala, 6, 6, thus were the Leuits prouided for.</p>
               <p>The third, Rom: 16, 4, that they aduenture to maintaine the preachers, though it be ſometimes to endanger them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
               <p>The fourth, not to receiue an occaſion againſt them, but vnder two or three witneſſes. 1, Tim, 5, 19.</p>
               <p>The fift, to vſe them more ſecretly in caſes of conſcience, then we will others.</p>
               <p>To our ſpirituall mother we owe: 1 to iudge that ſhee is the keeper, witneſſer, interpreter of the Scriptures, &amp; that the authoritie of the Church hangeth vpon the ſcriptures, the ſcriptures not vpon the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2 We muſt keepe the peace of the Church. 3 We muſt not depart from the Church, if it hold the foundation. 4
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1866:51"/>We muſt duly reuerence the iuſt cenſures of the Church.</p>
               <p>To the father of the country, that is the Soueraigne, 1 not to curſe him in our thought, nor in our bed-chamber.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To take lawes and money of his making: 3 to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at his commaundement.</p>
               <p>To the inferior Magiſtrate, to aſſiſt him for the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of iuſtice.</p>
               <p>All ſchollers, of neuer ſo high or great place, muſt yeelde all ſeemely dutie to theyr Teachers.</p>
               <p>Wiues owe to theyr husbandes ſubiection, Ephe, 5, 24, ſubmiſſion, 22, as to the Lord, this is comlie, Colo, 3, 18, and is from that lawe, Gene, 3, 16. in the generall honour which was ſpoken of before. For indeed the wife is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the man, 1, Cor, 11, 7, that is, ſhe ought to doe to her husbands glory rather then her owne, and that in her attire, and ſuch things, which while they are coſtlier or gayer then their husbands, is to his diſhonour, if it be with neglect of his commaundement to the contrary, with impayring his eſtate, leeſing his authoritie ouer her.</p>
               <p>To the nurce we muſt not be vnkind.</p>
               <p>Maiſters muſt haue theyr honour of fidelitie, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell-keeping. Looke vpon Abrahams ſeruaunt, Gene, 24, Vpon Ioſeph in Egypt, before he was in priſon, when hee was in fauor with Pharaoh, looke vpon Iacob with Laban.</p>
               <p>Let old men haue theyr due of experience, neuer to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braide them with the faultes of age. Looke Iob, 32, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>To them who excell vs in gifts this honour is due: 1 that we in honeſt and plaine meaning acknowledge ſuch gifts, without hiding, leſſening, deprauing.</p>
               <p n="2">2 We muſt thanke God for them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 We muſt imitate them as farre as our kinde of life will ſuffer.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Wee muſt incourage all we can, thoſe, in whom ſuch gifts are.</p>
               <p>To ſuch as excell vs in blood, we muſt yeeld that which the lawe, and our country cuſtomes and curteſies affoord.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the thing.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:52"/>
               <p> A queſtion may be, whether a man may giue ouer, and not take the honour due vnto him?</p>
               <p>Aunſwer. The honour is commaunded by GOD, and therefore none may releaſe it but God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. What if one be a childe one way, and a Father another way?</p>
               <p>Aun. He muſt giue and take honour accordingly.</p>
               <p>Queſt. Muſt this honour once giuen, continue the ſame to the ſame partie?</p>
               <p>Aunſw. No longer then hee continueth in ſuch a kind a Father.</p>
               <p>Thus far hath beene the dutie, the promiſe followeth: the which is not read alike by all Interpreters.</p>
               <p>The word which is tranſlated <hi>that thy dayes may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed,</hi> may be taken paſſiuely, or actiuely. Paſſiuely, as ſome other words, Iob, 4, 19. Luke 16, 19, in which ſence ſome take it heere.</p>
               <p>Actiuely, <hi>that they may prolong,</hi> in ſuch ſence ſpeaketh Paule, 1, Tim, 4, 16. Iam: 5, 20, Acts, 26, 18.</p>
               <p>Thus it ſeemeth to be taken heere, as it is elſe-where, and as ſome learned men thinke: wherefore let vs reade it, <hi>that they may prolong thy dayes, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherein we may conſider the kinde of the gift, and the meanes of it.</p>
               <p>The kinde of the gift is, <hi>prolonging of daies, vpon the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meanes are, parents.</p>
               <p>In the kinde is the naming of the gift, and ſetting out of it. It is named, <hi>prolonging of dayes,</hi> ſet out by <hi>the Land which the Lord giueth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The chiefe thing is <hi>dayes,</hi> ſet out by <hi>prolonging.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dayes,</hi> by an vſuall manner of ſpeech in ſcriptures, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie time, becauſe a day was the firſt ſenſible diſtinction of time.</p>
               <p>Now, though nothing elſe be named, ſomewhat muſt be vnderſtood, for onely to haue dayes may be no great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, as in all of them to be in death.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:1866:52"/>
               <p> Hee meaneth therefore dayes of life naturall, ciuill, not onely ſo, for though a man had neuer ſo many daies, yet liue in ſickneſſe, want, diſgrace, his increaſed dayes ſhould increaſe his woe.</p>
               <p>Hee meaneth therefore dayes of life floriſhing in good health, and outward fauours of God, as Eſay, 65, 20, 21. for indeed life is not to liue, but to be in good health.</p>
               <p>Prolonging, is not a lengthening aboue the appointed time, but granting from the firſt a long time of life.</p>
               <p>So that now this prolonging of daies, is the floriſhing condition of any ſtate, familie, or perſon, wherein is quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and peace, 1, Tim, 2, 2, Wealth, Rom, 13, 4. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what may appeare by the contrary, Eſay, 3, 4, 5, 13, &amp; Pro. 30, 17.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It muſt be remembred, this promiſe is not made for the defect of the former dutie performed, but vpon Gods own meere mercie, to ſhew how acceptable the dutie is.</p>
               <p n="2">2 We are not to iudge alwaies of the fauour of GOD to ſaluation, by this benefit, for ſometimes it is beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wicked: nor on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to thinke that where it is not, that therefore there Gods diſpleaſure to damnation is.</p>
               <p>But then may we iudge, that wee are in good eſtate with it, if in it we profit in all-ſauing graces, if we vſe long life to make vs approch the neerer to heauen, and likewiſe vſe it to the good of the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3 This gift is not generall and perpetuall, but as GOD ſeeth it expedient for vs, wherefore, if the queſtion be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, why God alwaies doth not giue to the godly long life heere, it may be aunſwered, it is becauſe that God doth ſee that it is not the beſt for them.</p>
               <p>Againe, this promiſe is more for a ſtate in generall of a kingdome, country, or corporation, where this duetie is performed, that it ſhall floriſh, then that euery ſpeciall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhall haue long life.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if God while hee promiſeth long life, giue euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, he breaketh not his promiſe.</p>
               <p>Hetherto the gift named, the ſetting out of it further fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
<pb facs="tcp:1866:53"/>
                  <hi>vpon the Land which the Lord thy God giueth thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where mention is made of a Land, and the giuer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>This Land no doubt was the land of Canaan, which God promiſed to his people when they came out of Egipt vnder Moſes conduct, and afterward gaue it vnto them by Ioſhua, wherein they afterward continued, vntil they were carried captiue elſwhere. Yet ſo as that it is true of any land where God ſetteth his people, yea any Citty, Towne, or houſe.</p>
               <p>Now this land aboue others is mentioned, becauſe it was a ſacrament of the heauenly Land. So as that:</p>
               <p>Godlineſſe hath the promiſe of this, and that life which is to come.</p>
               <p>In outward benefits of this life, we ſhould be lifted vp to thinke of others, and that life which is afterward.</p>
               <p>The giuer of this land is <hi>the Lord thy God.</hi> Theſe are the words of couenaunt.</p>
               <p>So as Gods couenaunt to vs, is the ground of all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours to vs, in which if we be not, we cannot looke for any thing wherein we may haue comfort. We haue nothing of our ſelues, it is Gods gift.</p>
               <p>Any thing that we haue, muſt we thanke him for when we haue it, and ſeeke it of him when we want it.</p>
               <p>If God giue earth, much more giueth he heauen, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life.</p>
               <p>Thus farre the kinde of the gift, the meanes follow, <hi>they,</hi> that is thy father and mother, as ſaith the wiſe man. Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticus, 3, 10.</p>
               <p>Now parents are ſaid thus to doe, as Timotheus is ſaid to ſaue himſelfe and thoſe that heard him, 1, Tim, 4, 16, while he is the meanes of theyr ſaluation.</p>
               <p>So parents are ſayd to prolong their children, when they are meanes thereof, &amp; indeauour themſelues in ſuch things as may procure the ſame.</p>
               <p>This they doe in diſcharging their duties euery way, as before hath beene ſet downe.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:1866:53"/>
               <p> And heere the Parents bleſſing is to be thought of, which no doubt is much to be reſpected.</p>
               <p>VVe muſt put difference betweene the bleſſings of the Patriarks, Abraham, Iſaac, and Iaacob, and ſuch others vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their children, and betweene the bleſſings of other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon men.</p>
               <p>The Patriarches, and ſuch parties were propheticall, and certainly did foretell what ſhould be, by diuine inſpiration, other mens bleſſings are but in wiſh, and deſires by prayer.</p>
               <p>And this bleſſing of parents, is an earneſt deſire of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that thinges may befall the children according to the will of God. Which in good may be looked for, when</p>
               <p n="1">1 Parents haue done their dutie towards their children.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Children haue obeyed theyr parents.</p>
               <p>In euill may be feared, when parents haue done theyr du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and children will not obey: but neuer if parents wiſh euill when theyr children doe well.</p>
               <p>Parents are therefore too blame, which inioyne euill things to their children vppon their bleſſing as they ſay, for that curſe cauſeleſſe, ſhall be fruitleſſe.</p>
               <p>So are thoſe that are giuen to curſing.</p>

               <p>The thing is, <hi>not to kill. Kill,</hi> is to take away life, and yet not ſimply to take away life is forbidden, but the life of a reaſonable creature: otherwiſe, a man may kill his beaſt for neceſſarie vſe.</p>

               <p>Life is whereby any thing liueth.</p>
               <p>Life is ſpirituall, ciuill, naturall.</p>
               <p>Spirituall life, when by the eſpeciall worke of the holie Ghoſt, a reaſonable creature liueth to the pleaſing of God.

               </p>
               <p>This kinde of life, one taketh away, 1 by denying the meanes, as parents of what ſort ſo euer, with-holding the word of God from theyrs.</p>
               <p n="2">2 By giuing of ſcandall. Scandall is occaſion of ſinne: in which reſpect, Paule biddeth to take heede that our weake brother periſh not, 1, Cor, 8, 11, and Chriſt threatneth woe to him by whom offences come. Luke 17, 1, 2. Looke Rom, 14.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:1866:54"/>
               <p> This life we muſt procure all wee can. Iohn, 1, 5, 16. So were the Apoſtles commaunded, Acts, 5, 20. For this cauſe would not the Apoſtles depart from Chriſt. Ioh, 6, 68.</p>
               <p>Ciuill life is that eſtate which one hath in ciuill ſocietie, as of honour, office, reputation: and this muſt be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>Naturall life is that, which is in the ioyning of ſoule and body together.</p>
               <p>Naturall life hath three degrees. The firſt is, cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the hart: In this reſpect God blameth the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who made the hart of the righteous ſad. Ezech, 13, 22, for indeede a ſorrowfull minde dryeth the bones. Pro. 17, 22. Thus did Naball firſt begin to die. 1, Sam, 25, 37, &amp; thus was Rebekah wearie of her life. Gene, 27, 46, for her griefe of hart at Eſaus taking of wiues.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is ſoundnes of bodie, when euery member is maintained, none hurt, none taken away, ſo as if any be impaired, it is againſt life, for life is of all parts. Thoſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who cut off a member, offend againſt the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt is health, when euery member and power dooth his worke. Hence is it ſaid, that life is to be in good health, and not onely to liue: therefore dooth Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than note his fathers fault, who made the people weake and faint. 1, Sam, 14, 30. Therefore is it, Iohn, 4, 50. <hi>thy ſonne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,</hi> for is in good health: ſo ſaith Paule, <hi>now are we aliue,</hi> that is, are whole and well, <hi>if ye continue ſtedfast. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, all ſuch who procure ſurfet or drunkennes, breake this commaundement.</p>
               <p>But what neede we goe far for opening of this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement? our Sauiour Chriſt hath doone that moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, Math, 5, 22, &amp;c. and that by ſhewing the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for the breach thereof in three degrees.</p>
               <p>In euery of theſe three degrees, hee ſetteth downe the fault, and the grieuouſnes thereof.</p>
               <p>The firſt degree is, <hi>Who ſoeuer is angry with his brother vnaduiſedly, ſhall be culpable of iudgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:55"/>
               <p> The fault is, <hi>to be angry with his brother vnaduiſedly:</hi> this is murther in hart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother is as before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To be angry,</hi> is to be diſpleaſed, with deſire of reuenge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In vaine,</hi> is when it is without iuſt cauſe or occaſion, as Caine was angry with Abel, Ahab with Naboth, Saul with Dauid.</p>
               <p n="2">2 When it is too long. Ephe, 4, 26. for the ſunne ſhoulde not goe downe vppon our wrath.</p>
               <p n="3">3 When it doth vnſeemely appeare, in countenaunce, in geſture, in deede, or word.</p>
               <p>So as that Chriſtes meaning is, that we ſhould be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in our anger. So ſaith Iames, 1 We muſt <hi>be ſlowe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> and Paule, <hi>Be angry, but ſinne not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this behalfe, is Moſes much commended. Numbers, 12, 3.</p>
               <p>And heere we are to take heede, that neither anger doe vainly ariſe, and that though it doe iuſtly ariſe, it doe not rage, and both theſe from others to vs, or from our ſelues towards others.</p>
               <p>And firſt, that it doe not ariſe in vs by others vainlie, it ſhall be good for vs,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Alwaies before hand to conſider our corrupt nature, how eaſily it is prouoked to inkindle by anger, as gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and flaxe by fire: and therefore as they who haue ſuch commodities, knowing their qualitie, by warineſſe preſerue them long from burning, ſo may wee our natures, that they be not conſumed by anger, if we wil watch ouer them.

               <p n="4">4 Not to be ſuſpicious, one ſmall ſuſpition that wee are neglected, will raiſe great anger.</p>

               <p>And that we cauſe not anger to ariſe in others, we muſt be carefull.</p>
               <p>Alwaies prouided, that if they be angry at vs for good duties neceſſarily to be done, we are not to be diſcouraged: elſe ſhould Chriſt, &amp; other of his ſeruaunts, haue forborne their duties for other folkes angers.</p>
               <p>But to be free from giuing iuſt occaſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Neuer meddle with any without vertue of thy calling. Anger moſt commonly ariſeth, when men are out of their callings, idle, vnprofitable, buſie-bodies in others mens matters.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Deſerue well of all, they ſhall be more then beaſtly that then will be angry.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Marke mens diſpoſitions: ſuch as are giuen to anger, take heede of prouoking.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Alwaies giue as good ſpeech as poſſibly may be.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Be not haſtie to tell reports, &amp; when you report, make the beſt of it, ſo far as you may with good conſcience.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Though you be much prouoked, ſometimes hold your peace. Ierem, 28, 11.</p>
               <p n="7">7 You muſt ſometime forbeare your right.</p>
               <p>If anger ariſe in our ſelues, 1 let it not continue too long, it continueth too long, when it hindereth or leſſeneth any dutie of godlineſſe, or loue.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Doe nothing while that ſtirreth in you. <hi>Athenedorus</hi> wiſhed <hi>Augustus</hi> when he was angry to repeate the letters of the Alphabet, before hee did any thing: thinking that in the meane while, anger would alay. The ſame practiſe had <hi>Theodoſius. Artichas</hi> ſaid he would haue corrected his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt, but that himſelfe was angry. <hi>Fredericke</hi> the Duke of Saxony, when he was angry, would ſhut himſelfe vp in his
<pb facs="tcp:1866:56"/>cloſet, and let none come at him, till hee had maiſtered his anger.</p>
               <p>If it ariſe in others by our meanes, we muſt follow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes counſell, Math. 5, 23, 24, 25. God himſelfe was carefull preſently to pacifie Ionas, 4.</p>
               <p>The ſame muſt we do, yea though we giue no iuſt cauſe.</p>
               <p>Though the greeued party be inferiour to vs, though we be counted fooles for our labour.</p>
               <p>Yea, ſo farre ought we our ſelues to be from anger, that though all thinges were taken from vs, wee ſhould not for our owne ſakes be angry.</p>
               <p>A tryall whereof Luther ſaith, is, if wee can wiſh to be wronged and iniured. Nay one ſaith, then ſhall wee be free from anger, when whatſoeuer euill befall vs, we can thinke that we are not worthy of ſo good an eſtate.</p>
               <p>Now indeede well doth our Sauiour forbid anger, for of it commeth hatred, enuie, back-biting, and ſuch like, ſo as that vnleſſe the doore of anger be ſhut, the other as in an open flood-gate come ruſhing in.</p>
               <p>This anger is ſo forbidden, as that the contrary thereto is commaunded.</p>
               <p>Contrary to anger is that which we call liking, whereby without paſſion or ſtirring wee reſt well contented, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payed with our brother or ſiſter.</p>
               <p>This is the fault, the greeuouſnes followeth in the deſert of it, which is to be <hi>culpable of iudgement,</hi> that is a great fault deſeruing puniſhment, which our Sauiour ſetteth out by the manner of proceeding in the ciuill Courts among the Iewes.</p>
               <p>They had diuers: the ſmalleſt was wherein the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uirie or three in commiſſion ſate, who ended ſmaller mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ſet puniſhments accordingly.</p>
               <p>Nowe as thoſe Iudges did puniſh malefactors, though with gentle puniſhments: ſo this fault of being angry vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſedly, though it ſeeme ſmall, ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, as in thoſe Courts.</p>
               <p>This place therefore, and the like following of this kind,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1866:56"/>make nothing to proue veniall ſinnes: all ſhal be puniſhed according to their deſert. Now the wages of ſin is death.</p>
               <p>And that vnaduiſed anger is puniſhed, it may appeare in Moſes, who though he were otherwiſe meeke, grew when he ſmit the rocke twice ſo impatient and froward, as ſome think it to haue beene a chiefe cauſe why God was diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with him, that he would not let him enter into the land of Chanaan.</p>
               <p>The ſecond degree followeth, <hi>Whoſoeuer ſaith to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Raca, ſhall be woorthy to be puniſhed by the Counſell.</hi> Where is the fault likewiſe, and greeuouſnes thereof.</p>
               <p>The fault is, <hi>ſaying Raca to a brother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi> as before <hi>neighbours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Raca,</hi> all doe not interpret a-like.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth to be a broken ſpeech, of an angry mind, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out, and bewraying it ſelfe ſomewhat, though not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in token of miſlike, whereof there are diuers in euery language, as tuſh, fie, piſh, &amp;c. in ours.</p>
               <p>Some think it to be a diſgraciue ſpeech, much like when we ſpeake <hi>thou</hi> to one in ſcorne and contempt.</p>
               <p>Some thinke that it commeth of the word <hi>Rach</hi> in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, which ſignifieth to ſpet, as if <hi>Raca</hi> ſaying, did ſignifie that the party to whom it were ſaide, deſerued to bee ſpet vpon, or as that in contempt of him, we would not forbeare ſpetting in his preſence.</p>
               <p>Sure it is a note of miſlike, and may come of the word <hi>Ric,</hi> which ſignifieth empty or light head, before whom we care not in contempt to vſe ſome vnſeemely geſture in wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of miſlike. Num. 12.14. <hi>If her father had ſpet in her face,</hi> that is vſed ſome diſgrace vnto her, as this ſpetting was wont to be one, Looke Deut. 25, 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Raca</hi> then is the bewraying of an angry and feſtering mind, by ſome vnſeemely and vnperfect ſpeech or behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: And may be</p>
               <p n="1">1 In countenance, 2 mouth, as in mowes, &amp;c. 3 in words, as tuſh, fie, &amp;c. 4 in making a loud and vnſeemely noyſe. Eph. 4, 31. 4 in ſcoffing. Gal. 4.29.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb facs="tcp:1866:57"/> 5 In bitternes. Eph. 4, 31.</p>
               <p>Now heere as before, liking was commaunded, ſo open loue contrary to <hi>raca</hi> is enioyned, ſo as that wee ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it by all the meanes wee can: as geſture, voyce, and ſound, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>This is the fault, the puniſhment and greeuouſnes follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, <hi>ſhall be worthy to be puniſhed by the Counſell.</hi> Heere as before, our Sauiour taketh a compariſon from the Iewiſh courts: for as before hee expreſſed the puniſhment due to the former faults, comparing it with the puniſhment in a lower court, ſo doth hee heere. Aboue the former Court was one wherein 23 Iudges were in commiſſion. Theſe dealt in greater matters, and inflicted greater puniſhments. So ſhall they who offend in this kinde of ſaying <hi>Raca,</hi> haue greater puniſhment then the former.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt degree foloweth, <hi>Whoſoeuer ſaith foole, ſhall be worthy to be puniſhed with hell fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fault is to call foole. This terme is put for all vnſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie manifeſt behauiour, bewraying a ranckling and feſtered minde with anger and hatred: ſo as that this worde is not onely meant, but any of the like, or worſe meaning, as aſſe, blocke, dolt, knaue, and drab, whore, &amp;c, whereby we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the partie made to the image of God.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing that vile wordes are forbidden, it neceſſarily followeth, that blowes and ſuch like muſt be forborne.</p>
               <p>But it may be demaunded, may not Gouernours vſe ſuch ſpeeches ſome time?</p>
               <p>Aunſwere. The ſildomer the better: and though that Chriſt himſelfe did ſo, yet is it hard for vs to doe as hee did. He had the Spirit without meaſure, and could not ſin. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſometimes Gouernours may ſharply rebuke, 1 faults rather then men, and 2 men, onely in hatred of faults, with 3 loue, which deſireth the reformation of the offender.</p>
               <p>If they be angry vnaduiſedly, or diſcourage their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, they ſinne.</p>
               <p>Heere then all manifeſt ſignes in ſpeech and deede, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraying anger and hatred, are condemned. Which beeing
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1866:57"/>many, I forbeare to reckon them vp.</p>
               <p>Now as all theſe practiſes are forbidden, the contrary i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> required, in all that we can, moſt manifeſtly to witneſſe our loue.</p>
               <p>The puniſhment of this fault remayneth, <hi>ſhall be worthy to be puniſhed with hell fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The moſt hardnes is in theſe words <hi>hell fire.</hi> In the Greeke they are, <hi>The Gehenna of fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The word <hi>Gehenna,</hi> commeth of two Hebrew words, <hi>Ge,</hi> which is valley, <hi>Hinnom,</hi> which is a mans name, who was the firſt owner of the place, the valley or dale of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> as <hi>Duſhen dale,</hi> &amp;c. ſo is it called, Ioſh. 15, ver. 8.</p>
               <p>In this valley the Iewes had the place <hi>Topheth,</hi> to burne their ſonnes and daughters in the fire, as Ier. 7, 31.</p>
               <p>Now by reaſon of the great fire which was vſually there, ſometimes <hi>Gehenna</hi> is put for the place and torments of the damned, as Math. 5, 29, 30. Math. 10, 28. Math. 23, 15. The doubt may be, how it ſhould be taken heere. Some thinke in the latter ſence. True it is that this ſin of calling foole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth hell: but yet I take it as in the former, ſo heere: our Sauiour had reſpect to the cuſtomes of the Iewes, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the former Courts and puniſhment, had where gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous faults were puniſhed, by ſtrangling, beheading, ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, burning: and becauſe that burning ſeemed to be moſt terrible, and was vſed in the valley of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> therefore our Sauiour ſheweth, that he that ſaieth foole, deſerueth a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter puniſhment then the former, in as much as the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the valley of <hi>Hinnom</hi> by fire, is more terrible then other puniſhments.</p>
               <p>All ſinnes are deadly in themſelues, yet one is greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, and deſerueth ſharper puniſhment then other.</p>
               <p>By this expoſition of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, wee may ſee, that as the murther of the hart and mouth, ſo neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt the murther of hand and deede be condemned: which is not onely in taking away life, but in giuing any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of taking it away.</p>
               <p>A man taketh away life from himſelfe, or from another.
<pb facs="tcp:1866:58"/>One may not take away his owne life. The commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is generall, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> And he that killeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, offereth violence to Gods image, which to preſerue, this law doth eſpecially commaund.</p>
               <p>We read not that Iob or Lazarus, or any in neuer ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable outward eſtate ſo did: and indeede ſo to doe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from vnbeliefe, by occaſion whereof the vvicked haue layd hands on themſelues, as Saul, Achitophel, Iudas and ſuch like. Nay <hi>Lucrecia</hi> ſo renowned among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, was too blame.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid, Razias in the booke of Macchabees is commended for killing himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Aunſwer. That booke is no part of the pure Canonicall ſcripture, properly ſo called. And there is the party co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ciuillie, rather then godly.</p>
               <p>What may we ſay of ſuch as in war haue put themſelues into ſuch dangers out of the which they neuer had hope to returne: of this ſort are they who runne vppon the Pikes, the forlorne hope, doe theſe kill themſelues?</p>
               <p>Aunſw. No. War is grounded on the word &amp; warrant of God, ſo as that all duties thereof are of ones calling: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, howſoeuer things ſeeme very dangerous and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, yet many in the middeſt of all them eſcape.</p>
               <p>Neither may a man take away another mans life, by Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian deuiſes, by force, or any way els.</p>

               <p>Pittie is to be ſhewed to the beaſts. Prou. 12, 10.</p>
               <p>Forbidden in this kinde is Combat, when the Iudge will haue a matter tried out by the ſworde, betweene two or more.</p>
               <p>This hath 1 no warrant out of ſcriptures. It may be ſaid, thus did Dauid and Goliah try it out. Aunſwere, that this
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1866:58"/>was extraordinarie: 2 it was in war, when ſome few may be hazarded, that thereby the reſt may be the ſafer.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Though it ſeeme too meane to try out truth: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the innocent may be ſlaine, we muſt not tempt God, nor doe euill that good may come of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It is ſildome without vniuſt anger, and vaine-glory.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaide of making a fray, which is not by law, nor ſo deliberate as the former, it is altogether vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, beeing from anger, in hatred, killeth all charitie what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it doth elſe, ouerthroweth patience, which is none if for euery conceiued wrong we muſt goe into the field.</p>
               <p>But one will ſay, he hath done me great wrong. Aunſw. Beare, or let the lawes reuenge for thee, not thine owne armes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore ſuch frayes as theſe muſt not be appointed, &amp; if they be appointed, they muſt not be kept. It is a great fault to make them, greater to keepe them.</p>

                  <hi>Commaundement.</hi> 7.</head>
               <p>This is the commandement for preſeruation of life, that which is for chaſtitie followeth: <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where firſt, conſider the order. This is ſet before that which followeth, to ſhew that the breach of this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, is a greater fault then to ſteale. Whereuppon in Gods law, hee who did ſteale, did onely make reſtitution, foure or fiue fold, but he who committed adultery was put to death, if it were but a breach into contracted mariage.</p>
               <p>So as that wee ſhould not thinke of the breach of thys commaundement, without great deteſtation: Howſoeuer ſome take it to be but a tricke of youth, Iude ſeemeth to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is brutiſh, 7, 10, and ſure there is nothing vvhich more dulleth the hart then this.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:59"/>
               <p> Marke it in Salomon, who when he followed fleſhly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, became moſt ſottiſh. And this ſinne is the greater, for that GOD hath allowed a generall remedie for all ſorts, to wit, mariage: ſo as the offenders haue nothing to excuſe themſelues by.</p>
               <p>Beſides, he that faileth heerein, ſinneth againſt his owne body, 1, Cor, 6, 15, making his body inſtrument &amp; obiect: otherwiſe then it is in euery other ſin.</p>
               <p>Queſt. Why doe our Gouernours ſet a greater puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon theft, then adulterie?</p>
               <p>Aunſw. They thinke that theft hindereth ſocietie more then adulterie.</p>
               <p>In this commaundement as in others, wee may conſider the perſon, and the thing.</p>
               <p>The perſon, <hi>thou,</hi> as before, none whoſoeuer, Courtier or any that thinke it a token of loue, &amp;c, none muſt offend.</p>
               <p>The thing forbidden, is <hi>adultery.</hi> Adultery is properlie betweene two perſons whereof one at the leaſt is married.</p>
               <p>Adulterie is heere put for other vncleanenes. The word in Hebrew may ſignifie whoredome, and may be read thus, <hi>Commit no whoredome.</hi> Whereby chaſtitie is commanded.</p>
               <p>Chaſtitie is abſtinence from all ſtrange and rouing luſts about the deſire of ſexe. Strange luſts are thoſe which are not according to nature, and which are not in or towards our married companion, husband or wife: or elſe Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is the pure and honeſt vſe of the power which GOD hath giuen to beget with, not onely for deede, but thought and deſire. So teacheth Chriſt, Math, 5, 28, which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be vnderſtood of a woman, ſo as if ſhee do likewiſe deſire to that end, ſhe doth offend: if it be beſide the owne husband, or owne wife.</p>
               <p>So as that a bodie may be free from touch, and yet not chaſt. Peter ſaith there be eyes full of adultery. 2, Pet, 2, 14. Or it is,</p>
               <p>The poſſeſſion of ones veſſell in holineſſe and honour. 1, Theſſ. 4.4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> is continuall ſo keeping, as Luke 21, 19, <hi>by your
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1866:59"/>patience poſſeſſe your ſoules, be constant in patience,</hi> ſo as that if one faile but once, he leeſeth the credite of continuance.</p>
               <p>This continuance is to be thought of for the returning of deſires, for deſires are at one time more ſtirred, and ſtronger then at an other: he that can forbeare in all ſtirring, he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth if he yeeld not, but reſiſt the temptation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Veſſell,</hi> all doe not vnderſtand alike: ſome take it for the whole body, and euery part: not much amiſſe, for indeede the whole body muſt be chaſt. It was well ſaid by one, It skilleth not in what part one be vncleane, if he be vncleane. Wherefore eyes, hands, &amp;c, muſt be ordered.</p>
               <p>Wee might ſtretch it though, ſome-what further to the ſoule, and ſo the whole perſon of man, wherein in euerie power he muſt be cleane.</p>
               <p>But ſubmitting that which I ſhall ſay to be iudged by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I take it by veſſell is meant that, which honeſtly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be named, and putteth difference betweene man and woman. In which ſence that place, 1, Sam, 21, 5, is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>the veſſels of the young men were holy,</hi> for he had ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Women haue beene ſeparate from vs theſe two or three dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where hee ſheweth what it is to haue the young mens veſſels holy, that is, ſeparate from women. This place the moſt learned <hi>Tremelius</hi> and <hi>Iunius,</hi> haue interpreted amiſſe, taking veſſels for implements neceſſary for their iourney. So ſpeaketh Plautus in <hi>Paenulo.</hi> I doe otherwiſe then adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers taken in the deede dooing, I come home with my veſſels ſafe and ſound: They were wont who tooke them in the deede, to cut of their priuities.</p>
               <p>Veſſell is the inſtrument of generation, as the Canoniſts ſpeake of vnnaturall venerie, <hi>extra vaſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is thus called, to teach vs to ſpeake &amp; thinke ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and chaſtly, to forbeare all ribaldry and filthy ſpeech.</p>
               <p>This veſſell muſt be poſſeſſed in holineſſe. This holines is in the pure vſe of it, euen in the preſence of God, where neither the perſon is defiled, the dutie and inſtrument not abuſed, by deed, word, looke, thought, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:60"/>
               <p> Beſides, it muſt be <hi>in honour,</hi> which is when we ſo vſe our ſelues, as that neither in our ſelues, nor before others, wee neede to be aſhamed. Sin in this kinde cauſeth ſhame, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of this ſin are likewiſe ſhame. Now then as on our vncomely parts we put on more honor, 1, Cor, 12, 23, that is, let them neuer ſhew their vnſeemlineſſe, but make them as handſome as we can, ſo muſt we procure all things heere.</p>
               <p>This chaſtitie is in ſingle, or married life.</p>
               <p>Single life is whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one liueth alone without the other ſex, and this is in maidens or widdowes life.</p>
               <p>Maiden or virgine life, is before one is married.</p>
               <p>Widowes life is after mariage, when the husband or wife is dead.</p>
               <p>Each of theſe is a pure forbearing of the act and motion, or ſtirring to begetting.</p>
               <p>Pure forbearing is that which is free from all pollutions. Looke Ephe. 5, 12. ſo as that we muſt haue continent eyes and lookes.</p>
               <p>This chaſtitie in ſingle life, is not, nor neuer can be, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſpeciall gift. So ſaith Chriſt, Math, 19, 11, 12, &amp; Paule, 1, Cor, 7, 37.</p>
               <p>So as that without this gift, all vowes whatſoeuer, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in law, and voide at the inſtant.</p>
               <p>This gift is called continence, &amp; is a ſpeciall gift of God, whereby one can liue without the need of other ſexe to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie deſire.</p>
               <p>This gift, 1 GOD onely giueth: 2 it is rare, all haue it not: 3 it maketh vs not more acceptable to God: 4 ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is preferred before mariage chaſtitie.</p>
               <p>Onely in reſpect of ſome afflictions that then were vpon the Church, and for that ſometimes the duties of marriage leaue not a maried partie ſo free from worldly cares, as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life doth.</p>
               <p n="5">5 It is not perpetuall, hee that hath it, may haue it taken from him afterward.</p>
               <p>Chaſtitie in mariage life, is the bed vndefiled, Heb, 13, 4,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1866:60"/>in the lawfull vſe of the maried companion.</p>
               <p>Bed companie in maried parties one to other with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, is no ſinne, though many corruptions creepe into it, which it pleaſeth God for Chriſt to forgiue. Some cautions in this muſt be remembred.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Call to mind what Moſes hath, Leuit, 18, 19, &amp; 20, 18.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To faſt and pray they muſt forbeare. 1, Cor, 7, 5, that is, extraordinary, and ſet ſolemne prayer vpon ſome great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, els muſt they pray euery day. 1, Pet, 3, 7. vppon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie occaſion. The bridegroome newly married, muſt come out of his chamber, and the bride out of her bride-chamber. Ioel, 2, 16.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Parties muſt vſe grauitie and modeſtie. One ſaith, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie may commit adulterie with his or her maried compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He meaneth, he may ſin, in want of grauity and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie. As if,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Either partie be intemperate, and vſe mariage for bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh luſt, not for neceſſitie, and child-procreation.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Too much boldnes be before others. This was Iſaacks ouerſight, who though hee might doe that which hee did, ſhould not haue done it in other folkes ſight. Gene, 26, 8, therefore, Gene, 25, 67, he tooke her into his mothers tent. Marke that Sampſon, Iudg, 15, 1, would go into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>It is too much to vſe open dalying with ones own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion: too bad is the foule and filthy ſpeech of ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried folkes, ſpeaking openly of the ſecrets of marriage.</p>
               <p>Mariage is a lawful knitting together of one man and one woman, in vndeuided ſocietie, for remedie of luſt, comfort of life, bringing forth of children.</p>
               <p>This knitting is the moſt neere that can be, and hath full communion of all things betweene them, ſo as that theyr bodies, &amp;c, are not their owne. 1, Cor, 7, 4.</p>
               <p>Vndeuided ſocietie is that, which no cauſe, but warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table by the word of God can diſſolue.</p>
               <p>Lawful is that which is according to Gods lawes, and the lawes of honeſtie.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:61"/>
               <p> Gods lawes require that mariage ſhould be <hi>in the Lord.</hi> 1, Cor, 7, 39.</p>
               <p>That is in the Lord, which is, 1 betweene parties that do truly feare the Lord in pure religion. It is not lawfull to marie an Idolater.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Is in reuerence.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Is with conſent of parents: that is of the neceſſitie, not onely the honeſtie of marriage.</p>
               <p>Parents muſt not be too hard, or wilfull, but what God will, that ought they to will.</p>
               <p>And this mariage muſt be but of one man, and one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly woman. Many husbands for one wife, or many wiues for one husband, are not allowable.</p>
               <p>To haue many wiues, was a ſin in the Patriarches.</p>
               <p>Mariage is diſſolued according to the word of God by death, iuſt diuorce, malitious deſertions: and then the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiuer, and innocent partie, after due proceeding, may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie againe, though neuer ſo often: ſo as that ſecond, third, &amp;c, mariages are not vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>They of the Romane religion erre, in counting one to haue two wiues, who hath married againe after the firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage diſſolued, or who hath maried a widdow.</p>
               <p>To mariage God calleth all ſuch as haue not the gift of continencie, ſo as that they may not forbeare mariage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin. Looke 1, Cor, 7, 9.</p>
               <p>Yea any whoſoeuer haue made a vow to the contrarie. For no vow muſt binde to ſin, and a man muſt ſin, where he hath no gift to doe otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Thoſe haue not the gift of continencie who doe burne. 1, Cor, 7, 9.</p>
               <p>To burne, or to be burnt, all doe not vnderſtand alike. They of the Romiſh teaching holde, that it is to commit fornication, that is (I take it) whoredome, as though effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minateneſſe, Sodomy, and ſuch like, were no faults.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſpeaketh of a thing that few did take to be a ſin, many knew that fornication was, but hee noteth the roote, and originall thereof, concupiſcence, or deſire, which
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1866:61"/>few did know. Rom, 7.</p>
               <p>And ſurely it were very ſtrange, if onely before fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Apoſtle ſhould preferre mariage, ſuch an honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ordinaunce of God as was giuen in mans innocencie.</p>
               <p>To burne therefore, or to be burnt in the place before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, is to be interpreted according to the vſe of tongues and ſpeech. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgill</hi> ſaith of <hi>Dido,</hi> wretched woman, ſhee is burnt, or burneth after <hi>Aeneas.</hi> Another ſaith, that <hi>Cupids</hi> darts are dipt in fire.</p>
               <p>Earneſt deſires are meant. So Hoſea, 7, 4, they are as an ouen heated by the Baker. Paule ſpeaketh more plainlie, Rom, 1, 27. they burned in luſt one toward another. So is it taken heere to be burnt, or burne with luſts: which is when a partie hath an vnconquerable armie of vnchaſt thoughts and deſires in him, diſhonouring him and his veſſel.</p>
               <p>Thoughts and deſires, ſignifie all motions, army, manie and oft, for ſildome is any alone.</p>
               <p>Vnchaſt are thoſe which are not toward ones owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried companion.</p>
               <p>Vnconquerable they are, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they cannot be ouercome, but doe ouercome and make one yeeld to them. This one ſhall finde in himſelfe, if hee cannot with quiet conſcience liue in the feare of God, &amp; diſcharge of his dutie, but theſe thoughts will poſſeſſe, they are vnconquerable. Wee may not vſe phiſicke which deſtroyeth nature, to take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ſince that we haue a remedie.</p>
               <p>Such as may be maſtered, muſt, neither muſt we for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be called to marriage.</p>
               <p>Meanes to quell luſts and thoughts are, 1 moderate diet, eſpecially in not beeing giuen to wine or ſtrong drinke: 2 Not too much ſleepe, nor too ſoft attire: 3 Companie: 4 Talke: 5 Spectacles, pictures, or ſuch like readings amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. To theſe muſt alwaies be ioyned; 6 exerciſe of the word, 7 prayer with faſting, not to hurt the body.</p>
               <p>But one may ſay, how may I know whether I haue vſed theſe meanes ſufficientlie?</p>
               <p>Aunſw. Indeed it is ſomewhat hard ſo to doe: 1 but be
<pb facs="tcp:1866:62"/>conſtant and earneſt in the meanes, and God ſhall in time giue vs to ſee. 2 Chooſe out ſome faithfull eperienced men to whom open your hart, and heare them. 3 After the vſe of meanes, finding no ſetled perſwaſion, I take it the ſafeſt for a partie to thinke that hee hath not the gift, becauſe it is rare.</p>
               <p>What if in mariage I cannot containe?</p>
               <p>I hope none is ſo vile, that were moſt fearefull, there is no remedie for ſuch, till they die.</p>
               <p>This is the thing commaunded, whereby the contrarie forbidden, might eaſily be ſet downe but to ſpare labour, &amp; leaſt while I ſhould ſet it out to auoide, ſome might take to follow it, this that hath been ſaid of one onely part, ſhall ſuffice.</p>

               <p>Calling is a way to liue by. Honeſt it is when none can iuſtly ſpeake euill of it. Lawfull, when according to the lawes of our Country.</p>
               <p>God liketh it, 1 when it ſerueth to ſome good, perſonall or publique, worldly or heauenly.</p>

               <p>Neceſſitie is that which the perſon or ſtate cannot want for the beeing thereof, as the word of GOD for the ſoule, meate, drinke, and apparell for the body, &amp;c, and heere the more neceſſary, for the more in the ſame kinde a thing is, the kind of life that dealeth therein is the better.</p>
               <p>Delight is for the more comfortable being of a perſon or ſlate, and muſt be alwaies without ſin, to duties of honeſty, as muſicke, and ſuch like: beſides, it muſt be alwaies ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and moderate.</p>

                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not beare falſe witneſſe against thy neighbour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome man may doubt, whether truth &amp; good name ſhould be leſſe then goods, becauſe they are ſet after them? They are not, but are far to be preferred before them, and yet heere ſet after, for that goods are neceſſary for life, truth and good name for good and comfortable life: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore onely in that reſpect ſet behind.</p>
               <p>In this commaundement, beſide the perſon, wee muſt conſider the thing, which is, <hi>bearing falſe witnes againſt ones neighbour.</hi> This doth forbid. The thing forbidden, is <hi>falſe witneſſe bearing,</hi> the party againſt whom is <hi>our neighbour.</hi> A party whom you haue need of, or may vſe, or who may vſe and haue neede of you.</p>
               <p>Our Engliſh is, that <hi>we must not beare falſe witnes against ſuch a one,</hi> as though onely hurt to our neighbour heereby were forbidden: in Hebrew it is <hi>Beth,</hi> which the learned know may be read as well <hi>toward,</hi> or <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning, about</hi> or <hi>tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, &amp;c.</hi> So as that not onely hurt is forbidden, but anie falſhood any way of, or to our neighbour.</p>
               <p>That which is tranſlated <hi>bearing,</hi> is in Hebrew, <hi>ſhalt not aunſwere,</hi> that is, ſhalt not ſay, or cauſe to be ſaid.</p>
               <p>So is aunſwering in ſcriptures put for ſpeaking, as Math, 11, 25. So Prou, 15, 1, A ſoft aunſwere, is a ſoft ſpeech.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Falſe,</hi> in the Hebrew is of falſhood, implying that the party meaneth falſly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Watnes,</hi> any ſhewing of any thing, as Ioh, 1, 7.1. Cor. 15.15.
<pb facs="tcp:1866:64"/>This is ſaid to be falſe when it ſheweth otherwiſe then the thing is, in whole or part.</p>
               <p>This witneſſe is toward things, or perſons, &amp; ſo it is falſe generally, ſpecially.</p>
               <p>Generally it is falſe, when it witneſſeth otherwiſe then the thing is.</p>
               <p>Specially it is falſe, when it witneſſeth otherwiſe then the perſon is.</p>
               <p>Heere therefore is commanded: 1 loue of truth, which by the light of nature the heathen could acknowledge.</p>
               <p>Truth is, ſhewing a thing as it is. Truth is aſſertorie, or promiſſorie.</p>
               <p>Aſſertorie, of a thing preſent or paſt: promiſſory, of a thing to come.</p>
               <p>Promiſe muſt be voluntary: 2 of a thing lawful: 3 in the promiſers power: 4 till it be vpon iuſt occaſion altered.</p>
               <p>And this is required, Ephe, 4, 25, performed, Pſalme, 15, and Pſalme, 101.</p>
               <p>It appeateth publiquely, priuately.</p>
               <p>It muſt wholy be told when iuſt occaſion requireth, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe not.</p>
               <p>Not to tell the truth when one is called (though hee ſay no falſhood) is to offend.</p>
               <p>Truth beeing commaunded, the contrary, to wit, lying, is forbidden, as Ephe, 4, 25, Hoſea, 4, 2.</p>
               <p>In a lie, is: 1 falſhood, 2 knowledge in the ſpeaker or vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, that it is falſe which is ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Some ſay it is one thing to lye, and another to tell a lye. Tell a lie he doth, which telleth a falſhood when he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it is true.</p>
               <p>Lying, is when one knoweth it falſe, and yet telleth it.</p>

               <p>It may be ſaid that Abraham, Gent, 20, 2, Iſaac, Gen, 26, 7. the Midwiues, Exod, 1, 19. Rahab, Ioſhua 2, 4, &amp; others did lye.</p>
               <p>Aunſw. They might ſin, we muſt not looke what they did, but how well, and vppon what warrant I take it, it was theſe worthy perſonages fault that they ſo ſhifted for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
               <p>But what may wee thinke of ſtratagemes and deuiſes in war to beguile an enemie?</p>
               <p>Anſw. They are lawfull, ſo be they be not by forſworne eſpials, without lying. From an enemy in war, men looke for the worſt, and all meanes of weakening force and craft are vſed. Nay God himſelfe in the ſcriptures, teacheth to vſe ſuch deuiſes.</p>
               <p>Wee haue the more neede to ſtriue againſt lying in our ſelues, for that we haue many prouocations thereunto. Our owne 1 lightneſſe, and corruption: 2 too much reſpect of other: 3 our owne pleaſure and commoditie: 4 want of zeale for the glorie of God.</p>
               <p>We may be diſcouraged from lying, if wee conſider that wee ought to be earneſt for Gods glory, with the deſire wherof, lying will not ſtand. Ioſua, 7, 19. If we think of the danger by lying. He that will lye, will eaſily forſweare. Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouerturneth all humane ſocietie, in that one cannot tell whom to truſt. Marke likewiſe howe God puniſhed lying in Ananias and Saphira, Acts 5, 3, 4, 5, and Simon Magus, Geheſai, 2, Kings, 5, 25, 27. &amp;c. Lying is of the deuill.</p>
               <p>Thus much for falſe witneſſe againſt the thing: againſt the perſon followeth, which is, againſt the good report of a partie.</p>
               <p>In regard of witneſſe touching a partie, we may conſider our ſelues and others, for getting good name, and for kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of it. And firſt for our ſelues &amp; others ioyntly. What a treaſure a good name is indeede aboue all outward things,
<pb facs="tcp:1866:65"/>may appeare. Eccle. 7, 3, Pro. 22, 1. whereby is declared that a good name is precious, of worth in it ſelfe, and profitable and of vſe: it is profitable now and after, like ſweete per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, preſently refreſhing, preſeruing againſt afterward. Now wee are commaunded to procure things of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and for that who hath an euill name, is halfe hanged, &amp; will hardly euer recouer a good name againe. So as that he is diſſolute, who careth not what others thinke of him.</p>
               <p>Beſides, a good name is of great force to make our duties better accepted of others, &amp; to draw others more to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And as the parties place is greater: ſo more care is to be had, for and of a Magiſtrate and Miniſter.</p>
               <p>But firſt of all, we muſt conſider what good name is, that we may know the better how to procure it.</p>
               <p>Good name is the witneſſe of ſuch as can well iudge of the gifts of God in one.</p>
               <p>Well ſaid Ariſtotle, that honour was rather in the partie who honoureth, then in the partie who is honoured.</p>
               <p>Parties who will witneſſe, are the world, the godly, God himſelfe, a mans owne conſcience: will I ſay; not that all are competent witneſſes, eſpecially the world, in ſo much as Chriſt denounceth woe to ſuch, whom all prayſe, that is, the common worldings, Luke, 6, 26. Chriſt ſheweth, that it is impoſſible to beleeue for them who receiue honor one of another. Ioh, 5, 44, beeing of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſort. So as that we are not to depend vpon the common voice.</p>
               <p>But muſt a man therfore neglect witneſſe from euil men?</p>
               <p>Aunſw. No. For Paule requireth witneſſe for them who are without, 1, Tim, 3, 6, 2, Cor, 4, 2.</p>
               <p>Our chiefe care muſt be, that we giue them no iuſt cauſe to ſpeake euill of vs, rather then if they ſpeake without our deſert, to be much grieued for it.</p>
               <p>We may keepe good report from the wicked, ſo long as it is for our well-dooing which wee continue in, and if it be witneſſed by the godly, and God himſelfe, aſwel as by theſe.</p>
               <p>The godly who witnes, are ſuch as are effectually called. Theſe can beſt diſtinguiſh the gift and grace of God: good
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1866:65"/>witneſſe from theſe is comfortable. Euery one beſt iudgeth the things he knoweth.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, ſometimes brothers will diſſent, as Paule and Barnabas, Hieronimus and Auguſtine, this will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times exerciſe one.</p>
               <p>God &amp; a mans owne conſcience remaine, in whoſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for good, wee may more reioyce, then in all other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
               <p>The things for which one hath good fame, are the gifts and graces of God, ſo as that all faults and ſinnes are to be remooued. It is diſgrace to be prayſed for a ſin.</p>
               <p>Good fame nowe thus ſet out, or as Iohn ſetteth it out, Epiſtle 3, verſe 3, 6, the witnes of the brethren to the truth, and loue in the party, muſt we our ſelues, for our ſelues firſt ſeeke,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Rather dooing the thinges which may deſerue good fame, then ſeeking good fame barely for it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Neuer ſeeking fame but for the glory of God, &amp; grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good of others, to whom thereby our gifts may be the more welcome and profitable.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Though wee want good fame fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men, alwaies to haue good witneſſe from God, and our owne hart. This when we be dead, ſhall be our credit.</p>
               <p>Well then, wee may get good fame: If wee be iuſt. The memoriall of the iuſt ſhall be bleſſed. Prou, 10, 7.</p>
               <p>And 1 heere wee muſt take heede of ſecret ſinnes, for which ſometimes it pleaſeth God to correct vs by ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that goe of vs, which hinder our good name. A man muſt take heede of ſmall ſinnes, they will be increaſed if once they be ſpoken of, and once ſpoken of, they will ſtick long, occaſions muſt be auoyded. Hee that will doe no ill, muſt doe nothing that belongeth thereto. The world is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to make the worſt of any thing in another.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If we be carefull to preſerue other mens good name, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will preſerue ours.</p>

               <p>In this commaundement as before, is perſon, thing.</p>
               <p>Thing forbidden, is the <hi>coueting</hi> of that which is an <hi>others,</hi> where the kinde of thing forbidden is to <hi>couet,</hi> the thinges coueted, <hi>houſe, wife, ſeruant, &amp;c. of ones neighbour.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Coueting,</hi> or deſiring, is naturall, or not naturall. Naturall I call that which was in pure nature, as of meat and drinke for preſeruation of nature, &amp;c. this is not forbidden.</p>
               <p>Not naturall, is that which though it ariſe from vs, yet was not in pure nature, which is not ſimply forbidden, if it bee with condition of my neighbours liking, as if I wiſh to buy his houſe at his owne reaſonable price.</p>

Paul fetteth it out generally, Rom, 7, 7, whom wee may moſt ſafely follow to finde out the meaning of this place, which is to condemne the imagination of the thoughts of mans hart. Gene, 6, 5, &amp; 8, 21, which indeed are ſo by nature in all men &amp; women. Neither is that ſpeech more then plainly true, Gene, 6, 5, as may appeare, for that the like is repeated after the flood. Gene, 8, 21. and is alſo repeated by Paule, Rom, 7, 7. And though Noah be called iuſt, it was not for that he was ſo of himſelfe, but by Gods ſpeciall grace in forgiuing his ſin.</p>
               <p>This imagination is the firſt corrupt naturall motion of the vnderſtanding, and the will.</p>
               <p>It is in vs before and after Baptiſme, and is likewiſe ſin:

               <p>This certainly after Baptiſme is, as the Romaniſts doe not denie. 1 This is ſinne, which moſt ſpecially is noted in this commaundement.</p>
               <p>Paule calleth this ſin, Rom 7, 8, 9, ſo as one would mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile why the Counſell of Trent ſhould ſaie that it hath not the proper nature of ſin, as it doth.</p>

            <head>AN EXPOSITION vpon the Lords Supper.</head>
            <head type="sub">1. Corinth. 11.23. and ſo forth.</head>
            <p>AS the whole Epiſtle, ſo is this chapter correctiue, that is, to redreſſe diſorders crept into the Church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. Whereof two are mentioned heere, the one touching theyr habit and attire in prophecying and praying, the other about the Lords ſupper: the which is ſet downe from the 17. verſe to the end of the chapter. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are two things ſhewed, one what the fault of the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians was, from the 17. verſe to the 23. the other what the truth is, touching the ſupper of Chriſt, from the 23. verſe to the end of the chapter.</p>
            <p>This which ſheweth the truth to be had and held, ſetteth downe the firſt appointing and ordayning heereof, to the 28 verſe, then the right vſing and communicating thereof.</p>
            <p>The firſt appointing is taught, by the Author and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of this dutie, by the time, and the partes, and the vſe or end.</p>
            <p>The Author is the Lord, that is Chriſt, yea the Father, and the holy Ghoſt, that is the whole Trinitie. For none hath power to ordaine any thing to bind all Churches, and to continue for euer, to aſſure euerlaſting ſaluation as ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe, but onely the Lord.</p>
            <p>Que. But Paule heere ſaith, that hee deliuered this vnto them.</p>
            <p>Aunſwer. No further then he receiued from the Lord, euen that for matter and manner which hee had from him. And if we compare this place with the Euangeliſts, we ſhall ſee that Paule word for word hath ſet it downe as they did. Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:68"/> 1 It is not onely dangerous, but not lawfull to adde or take from the ſacrament, otherwiſe then at the firſt was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Queſt. Doth one celebrating the ſupper in the morning with men and women, more then twelue, &amp;c. agree with Chriſtes firſt inſtitution?</p>
            <p>Aun. Yea, but this muſt be remembred. Some things are of the nature and beeing of a ſacrament, whereto nothing muſt be put in that meaning, or taken from: other things are but acceſſary and beſides, in regard of time, place, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. So were ſundry things in the Paſſouer, &amp; in the Lords firſt ſupper, which though they be now altered, doe not ſhew that wee breake Chriſtes firſt appointment. Such are the time, the place, the number of perſons, the bread vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leauened, and others of that kind.</p>
            <p>The time when this was ordained, is the night, in which Chriſt was betrayed. Not onely to ſhew the aboliſhing of the Paſſeouer, but withall to declare the loue of Chriſt to his Church, who immediatly before his bitter ſuffering, had ſuch care of his, as alſo to make all thinke the more of this ſacrament, as beeing Chriſt his farewell token, as a pledge of his wonderfull kindneſſe.</p>
            <p>The parts and whole ſacrament follow. The which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can well vnderſtand, ſomewhat muſt be knowne, as to make a more eaſie paſſage heereunto.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Of all mankinde ſome onely are ſaued; that is, liue here in the fauour of God, and ſhall fully enioy it afterward.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Whoſoeuer are ſaued, are ſo by Gods mercifull agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with them in Chriſt, and for his ſake. So Ieremie 31, and Ephe. 2, 12.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Gods agreement, is his couenant and compact with his to ſaue them.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Thoſe who are in Gods couenant and agreement, are at one time or other called, that is, acquainted heerewith.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Thoſe who are called, haue this agreement and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant betweene God and them made knowne &amp; aſſured.</p>
            <p n="6">6 It is made knowne that there is ſuch an one in generall,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1866:68"/>by the preaching of the word.</p>
            <p n="7">7 It is aſſured ſometime by the Spirit alone, ſometimes alſo by outward other meanes.</p>
            <p n="8">8 By the Spirit, when the third perſon in Trinitie, other meanes not being to be had, perſwadeth a partie, that he is in the agreement or couenant of God.</p>
            <p n="9">9 By other meanes, when with the Spirit, ſome outward things are vſed to aſſure in particuler, and more euidently euen to ſence.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Theſe meanes are by learned Writers in the Church, called Sacraments. This word, though it be not in the Scripture thus taken, yet is the meaning of it.</p>
            <p n="11">11 A ſacrament is an ordinance of God, in the right vſe whereof the partaker hath aſſurance, of his being in Gods couenaunt of grace. In the due receiuing, I ſay, not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Euery ſacrament ſheweth to ſence one thing, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth and meaneth another. In circumciſion, the cutting away of the fleſh, ſignifieth the cutting off of ſinne, in the Paſſeouer the Lambe, Chriſt: the water of Baptiſme, Chriſtes blood, and the worke of the holy Ghoſt. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Euery ſacrament hath bare things or elements (as they call them) and actions or ceremonies.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Thing or element is a ſingle creature, as of vvater, bread, wine, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Action is ſome practiſe thereabouts, as ſprinkling, breaking, pouring out, deliuering, taking, eating, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="16">16 The chiefe thing ſignified in euery ſacrament, is Chriſt, God, and man, with all his merits, hauing fullie wrought the recouery to ſaluation, of euery due receiuer of the Sacrament.</p>
            <p n="17">17 The acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are of the

            <p n="18">18 The thing ſignifying, and thing ſignified, are in ſome
<pb facs="tcp:1866:69"/>ſort ioyned together, not euery way.</p>
            <p n="19">19 They are not together in the ſame place, not both gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by one partie, not giuen at one time, not to one part, not in one manner. For the bread, water, or wine is heere: Chriſt his body is in heauen. The Miniſter giueth the bread: GOD Chriſt his bodie. The bread may be giuen now: Chriſts body after. The bread is giuen to the hand &amp; mouth: Chriſt his body to the ſoule and faith. The bread is giuen after an ordinary manner: Chriſts body otherwiſe, for our ſoules by fayth mount vp to heauen, and lay hold of it there.</p>
            <p n="20">20 They are together, 1 In the right vſe, that is, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie dulie partaking hath both. 2 As a ſigne and the thing ſignified are together: for as the ſigne maketh the thing ſignified to be remembred, ſo doe the outward things cauſe the other to be thought of. 3 As a promiſe to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vpon condition, if the condition be kept on the one, the promiſe is on the other; ſo if wee keepe the conditions of the ſacraments, the things ſignified by them are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p n="21">21 Sacraments are Iewiſh, Chriſtian. Iewiſh among the Iewes till Chriſtes death: Chriſtian ordained by Chriſt, to continue among the Chriſtians to the end of the world.</p>

            <p n="23">23 Baptiſme is a ſacrament Chriſtian, aſſuring the firſt receiuing into, and beeing in the couenant of grace.</p>
            <p>The Lords ſupper is a Chriſtian ſacrament, aſſuring co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuaunce &amp; maintenaunce in the couenaunt of grace, the doctrine whereof is ſet downe 1, Cor. 11. as before. The parts whereof are two, one concerning the bread, the other concerning the cup.</p>
            <p>The bread is taken, and after thankſgiuing broken, with ſaying, <hi>Take, eate, this is my body. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This bread, though now vnleauened by occaſion of the Paſſeouer, was the vſuall bread they were wont the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1866:69"/>ſuch as ours in the ſacrament ſhould be, not wafers, not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leauened bread.</p>
            <p>By this bread was and is ſignified Chriſt. Firſt his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon God and man, performing all things for our ſaluation. Secondly his offices of King, Prophet, Prieſt. Thirdly, his deſerts in his liuing and dying, doing and ſuffering for our iuſtification, ſanctification, redemption, and whatſoeuer elſe for our euerlaſting happines.</p>
            <p>It pleaſed Chriſt to vſe bread to ſignifie this.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That becauſe that bread is a chiefe maintainer of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſtrength euen alone, ſo we ſhould know Chriſt is for our heauenly life, that if we haue nothing but him, we may make good ſhift.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That as bread is vſuall and daily, ſo ſhould Chriſt be vnto vs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That as bread is parable and at hand, ſo wee ſhould know God is as ready alwayes, and offereth himſelfe to them who ſeeke him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To put vs in minde, that as his naturall body is one, ſo we his miſticall ſhould be. 1. Cor. 10.</p>
            <p>This bread Chriſt tooke, according as the ceremonie at the Paſſeouer was.</p>
            <p>This taking of the bread was into the hands: and in the firſt inſtitution it was taken by Chriſt, as the good-man of the houſe vſed at the Paſſeouer, ſhewing the duty of all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to ſucceede.</p>
            <p>This taking muſt be conſidered as of the

            <p>Of the bread, ſhewing firſt the ſeperation of it from a common vſe, now it is foode for the ſoule, ſo is Chriſt ſet apart from common men. Iohn 17.</p>
            <p>Chriſt doth it firſt, to ſhew that himſelfe willingly giueth himſelfe for his Church, which ſerueth to ſtrengthen our faith and perſwaſion in his loue to vs.</p>
            <p>The Miniſter doth it as to repreſent God the fathers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, giuing his ſonne likewiſe to that end. So as that the
<pb facs="tcp:1866:70"/>whole Trinity ſealeth theſe things vnto vs.</p>
            <p>A ſecond action followeth, giuing thanks, Matthew and Mark haue, bleſſing, all is one.</p>
            <p>This was alſo according to the ceremonie in the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, in the name of the aſſembly.</p>
            <p>Giuing thanks &amp; bleſſing may haue two meanings, firſt as to God, ſo are they all one, ſecondly ouer the creature of bread, is all one. So that heere</p>
            <p n="1">1 Is ſhewed, that the outward creature is reuerently to be vſed, with calling vpon the name of God, in crauing aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to vſe this holy ordinance as we ſhould.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That we ſhould praiſe God, as for all fauours in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, ſo for our redemption by Chriſt, and aſſuring vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by this Sacrament.</p>
            <p>He brake according to the ceremonie at the Paſſeouer.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To deuide it. 2. To repreſent Chriſtes ſufferings.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Whole bread is not to be deliuered.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Bread muſt be broken to be deuided among ſundry, not as with the Papiſts, who breake, but doe not diſtribute alwayes.</p>
            <p n="3">3 We muſt neuer be preſent at this ceremonie, but call to minde Chriſtes torments for vs.</p>
            <p n="4">4 If Chriſt were tormented for vs, we muſt be greeued for our ſelues, for this ſerued the ſowre hearbs at the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, in theſe was Iudas ſop dipped.</p>
            <p>Matthew hath, that Chriſt gaue to his Diſciples, and did not offer to God. Indeede ſome writers call this a ſacrifice: not properly, 1 but a memorie of Chriſtes ſacrifice, 2 wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee ſacrifice our ſelues to God. 3 Giue almes to the poore, which is a kind of ſacrifice. And ſaid, that is, aloud and plainly that all might vnderſtand.</p>
            <p>All comming to this Sacrament, muſt haue knowledge of the word and this ſacrament.</p>
            <p>The Miniſter muſt not mumble as among the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>In the ſpeeches of Chriſt following in 4 braunches, wee may mark a commaundement, a promiſe, a duty of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauer.</p>

            <p>Matthew hath, <hi>This is my blood of the newe Testament,</hi> to the ſame ſence. So that the thing ſignified is the blood of Chriſt, and by vvine,</p>
            <p n="1">1 To teach that wee muſt haue ſome ſweet feeling of Chriſt. 2 And that it is he who cheareth our harts.</p>
            <p>Now this his blood is ſhed and poured out for vs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is ſignified his death and merits for vs.</p>
            <p>Note by the way the leproſie of ſin, which could not be cured, but by the blood of God.</p>
            <p>Teſtament in effect heere is the ſame with couenant, ſaue that teſtament or will implieth death. And is nothing, but Gods agreement with mankind for their ſaluation.</p>
            <p>This to continue and be effectuall, is but one. And is the pleaſure of God to ſaue men for Chriſtes ſake, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to diuers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderations is old, till Chriſt, for the Iewes, in ceremonies, and to vaniſh:</p>
            <p>New, not but that it was heeretofore, but was by Chriſt ſo cleerely publiſhed as it ſeemed new. 2 Shall not decay. 3 Renueth vs more and more. The benefits of this Ieremy ſetteth out 31 chap: and are the ſame we haue heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Chriſt. All which, this wine is giuen as a ſeale to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that they belong to the due receiuer.</p>
            <p>This muſt wee drinke as eate the former, by commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement in remembrance.</p>
            <p>Matthew hath, <hi>drinke yee all,</hi> as if our Lord would preuent the corruption in the Church of Rome.</p>
            <p>Obiect. Luke maketh mention of two cups. 22, 17, 20.
<pb facs="tcp:1866:72"/>How will both ſtand?</p>
            <p>Aun. The former was of the Paſſeouer, the latter vvas onely of the Lords ſupper.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the parts, the vſe followeth in the 26. which is eaſily vnderſtood by that which went before.</p>
            <p>Hetherto hath beene the doctrine of the inſtitution, now followeth that which is for the meete partaking thereof; from the beginning of verſe 27. to the end of the chapter.</p>
            <p>In which is declared the neceſſitie of meete partaking, &amp; the manner how.</p>
            <p>The neceſſitie is verſe 27, and is from the danger of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete or vnwoorthy receiuing, for none can receiue but worthily, or vnworthily.</p>
            <p>The danger is that the vnworthy receiuer ſhall be guiltie of the body and blood of the Lord. Where firſt wee muſt know what it is vnworthily to receiue, then what it is to be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Worthy or vnworthy, is with compariſon or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, &amp; that betweene
<list>
                  <item>Quantities.</item>
                  <item>Qualities.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Worth in quantitie, is equalitie, as a peny for a peny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth: worth in quality is likeneſſe, or comming neere.</p>
            <p>This vnworthily is meant of quantity, but quality.</p>
            <p>Vnworthily is not contrary or beſide the excellencie of the myſterie, or not in euery point not according to the dutie of the receiuer.</p>
            <p>For then none ſhould receiue worthily, as not beeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe as they ought.</p>
            <p>But vnworthily is vnmeetly, or vnlikely, ſo Math. 3. And the Ruler of the Synagogue thought himſelfe not worthy, that is, not meete. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This vnwoorthily muſt be iudged according to Chriſtes inſtitution of this ſacrament: ſo as that if wee vſe it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then he appointed we ſhould vſe it, it is vnworthily.</p>
            <p>To be guiltie of the body and blood of Chriſt, is to ſinne againſt the body and blood of Chriſt, that is againſt Chriſt himſelfe, and to be ſubiect to the puniſhments therefore, ſo
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1866:72"/>Math, 5, 21, 22. Iames, 2, 10.</p>
            <p>The fault is moſt grieuous, beeing againſt God, offering vs the blood of his couenaunt. Heb. 10, 28, 29. The wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof to themſelues, what hath it brought but noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and extreame miſery?</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, how may this be, ſeeing Chriſt his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is not there really?</p>
            <p>Aun. It is ſufficient that his ordinances are abuſed, and thoſe holy ſignes which he ordained, ſo deſpighted.</p>
            <p>So the reproch done to Princes pictures, armes, Letters, Embaſſadours, redoundeth to the Prince. Wee our ſelues ſo interprete things done toward our ſelues.</p>
            <p>None can from hence therefore gather, that wicked or worldly men, doe eate the body of Chriſt. They may eate (as S. Auguſtine ſaith) the bread of the Lord, they cannot eate, the bread the Lord, who to all receiuers is life.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the neceſſity of meete partaking, nowe followeth the manner how, and that from the 28 verſe on, the which firſt is ſhortly named, after is further enlarged.</p>
            <p>It is ſhortly named, verſe 28, and is ſaid to be examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The which we may conſider by the properties of it, &amp; by the nature and parts.</p>
            <p>The properties are firſt the neceſſitie, ſecond, the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, third, integritie, the ſpeciall parties who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it moſt chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie concerneth.</p>
            <p>The neceſſitie appeareth by therefore, the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo as that otherwiſe they ought not to partake, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they pleaſe God, or haue comfort in theyr harts. And indeede if men conſider the greatnes of the myſterie, ſearch and tryall cannot be but moſt neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Men muſt take heede that cuſtome doe not take away care, we muſt doe it for conſcience.</p>
            <p>The generalitie is in the word <hi>man,</hi> which ſignifieth male or female, old or young, of any degree. So that none to be admitted muſt be accepted, nor any to be accepted not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</p>
            <p>So is man taken. Iohn 3, 27. Iohn 5, 7. Iohn 7, 46.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:73"/>
            <p> The reaſon of this generalitie is, that Chriſtianitie, and the duties thereof, are as well for one as other. Neither is there any who hath not iuſt cauſe to try out himſelfe. Well therefore doth our Church appoint the names to bee ſent, that helpe may be had. None may be without his garment.</p>
            <p>The integritie or vprightnes in this tryall, is implied in the word, examine. Which ſheweth an exquiſite and moſt diligent ſearch, as Lapidaries, and Goldſmithes doe, to find out true from counterfeit, good from bad.</p>
            <p>Where a man had need of great skill, ſeeing the thing he ſeeketh is moſt excellent, and to be deceiued, is great loſſe. Now this examination muſt be ſuch, as euer to ſearch till we find our ſelues in good eſtate, as they who dig for met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, like the Shunanite to Eliſha, ſo Chriſt commandeth to ſeeke.</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, what if I finde not the thinges I looke for?</p>
            <p>I aunſwer. Preſently ſo ſet your ſelfe to ſeeke as you giue not ouer till you find. The things you looke for, are of meere neceſſity to euerlaſting ſaluation: and that not onely at the Sacrament, but all times before, and afterward.</p>
            <p>Therefore in this caſe muſt we doe as they who are ſick, hungry, for phiſicke and meate, not differing, and it is a manifeſt euill ſigne not to be earneſt this way.</p>
            <p>The perſons whom this examination concerneth, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man and party toward himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Not but that others, who haue charge of others, muſt endeuour. as Exod. 12, 26, 27. Deut, 6, 7, Gene. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>But that though they ſhould faile, yet euery party, muſt be able, willing, and practiſing to examine themſelues.</p>
            <p>No man can do this but he muſt 1 Take ſome time for it. 2 Remember in the dooing of it, hee hath to doe with God, who ſeeth to the ground of the hart. 3 Had neede of ſome inſtruction, and exerciſe before. 4 Muſt doe it as at other times, ſo ſpecially renue the dooing heereof at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie time of adminiſtring the Sacrament. 5 That which he now endeauoureth to find, he muſt haue for euer after.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1866:73"/>
            <p> Hetherto haue been the properties of examination, now follow the nature and parts thereof.</p>
            <p>Examination is an exerciſe of godlineſſe, whereby a man deſcendeth into himſelfe, bethinking what hee ought to haue, neuer giuing ouer till he haue ſuch graces, as whereby he may partake the ſacrament of the body &amp; blood of our Lord worthily.</p>
            <p>This exerciſe is many wheres commended in ſcriptures. 2. Cor. 13. the neglect blamed. No man conſidereth what haue I done. Looke Haggeus.</p>
            <p>It calleth a man home to himſelfe. Pſalm, 4, 4. Zepha: 2, 1. Will not let a man be more buſie then needes, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>Beeing bethinking, it muſt be with deliberation.</p>
            <p>The things which examination looketh for, muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the particuler intent in examination, as if I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min whether I haue thinges to make mee fit to heare the word, I looke one way, if to make prayers, I looke another way: ſo if for the Sacrament, there is a ſpeciall courſe for that likewiſe to be taken.</p>
            <p>Now the things which examination for this Sacrament muſt looke after, may be conſidered in their number, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and meaſure.</p>
            <p>The number we will not ſtand preciſely vppon, foure is the ſmalleſt. The firſt is knowledge. This is the perceiuing of the meaning of truth neceſſarie to ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Which muſt be as of truth in generall, 1 That there is one God, three perſons.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That man was created at the firſt to the image of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That man fell, and plunged himſelfe and his poſteritie into miſery, from whence by nothing in himſelfe or others he can get out.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That there is no way to be recouered from hence, but onely by Chriſt, according to the articles in the Creede.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That then hee know what faith is, and how that onely by that, Chriſt is apprehended.</p>
            <p n="6">6 That faith is neuer ſufficient if it be without repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:74"/> 7 That repentance alwaies cleaueth to Gods ordinances and commaundements.</p>
            <p>So alſo in ſpeciall touching the doctrine of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and this in particuler.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is a mans owne ſinnes, which hath as farre as one can indeauour, 1 The finding out of the number and grieuouſnes.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The acknowledging of them to God &amp; others, againſt whom they haue been.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The beeing truly ſory for them.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The deſiring of forgiueneſſe for them.</p>
            <p>The beſt way to find out, is to lay the law &amp; word of God rightly vnderſtood to our harts, and bethinke of our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer practiſes.</p>
            <p>The third is faith of ſaluation, which is a perſwaſion by the holy Ghoſt, that the doctrine of ſaluation by Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vnto the partie.</p>
            <p>The fourth is repentance, or amendement of life, which muſt be 1 Of the whole man. 2 Alwayes. 3 Profiting and going forward. And hath two parts, mortification, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uification.</p>
            <p>Mortification is keeping vnder, and weakening of ſin.</p>
            <p>Viuification is renuing of deſires and endeauours to all good things.</p>
            <p>This is the number, the qualitie followeth, which is, that there muſt be 1 Truth of euery of the former.</p>
            <p>Which one ſhall iudge of, if in the preſence of God, he can finde theſe things in himſelfe. 2 If they be working.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Preſentneſſe, that euen at the inſtant the partie can find them in himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Refreſhing, that euen by this ſacrament he muſt finde all the former quickned, and renued.</p>
            <p>The meaſure is laſt, which is to be wiſhed as great as may be, and muſt not diſcourage if it be but little.</p>
            <p>The meaſure of ſauing graces, are not in all equall.</p>
            <p>The weaker our grace is, the more neede haue we of the ſtronger meanes.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1866:74"/>
            <p> Competent meaſure is iudged by an vpright heart to pleaſe God in the vſe of this ordinance.</p>
            <p>So as that no weakeneſſe or ſlippes muſt diſcourage vs. 2 No croſſes. 3 No tentations.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the manner how meetly one is to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, now followeth the further enlarging thereof, and that from repeating this danger of neglect of examination, 29, 30, as alſo from the fruite of due examination. verſe 31.</p>
            <p>The danger of neglect is in the puniſhment

For that the Apoſtle expoundeth himſelfe. verſe 30.32. And for that ſundry thus offending, were the children of God, who could not be damned.</p>
            <p>I take it therefore to ſignifie iudgement, as 1, Peter 4. that is, puniſhment, or correction, as is ſaid, <hi>Correct vs in thy iudgement, &amp;c.</hi> in which caſe Hezechiah prayeth, 2, Chron, 30, 18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>So the meaning is, the parties neglecting ſhall be ſubiect to puniſhment, euen vpon the careleſnes or rechleſneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this ſacrament, and iuſtly, this beeing an ordinance of God, ſo full of good for vs.</p>
            <p>Now that which is true in the receiuing,

For heere ſeemeth to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood puniſhment indeede, but eaſier, there a man may iuſtly feare hell fire.</p>

            <p>Conſiderations to make vs reſort vnto it, with due conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. Where firſt we might bewaile, that it is of all ſo ſlightly regarded.</p>

            <p>Now no iudgement is expreſſed, becauſe we might feare all. No time named, that alwaies we ſhould feare them.</p>
            <p>The cauſe is, for that he diſcerneth not the Lords bodie, that is, that which is his body by his ordinance ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tally.</p>

            <p>This word is called by another name, vſually the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> ſo Acts 20, 24, the <hi>Goſpell of grace, word of the kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the name we heard of it, in the entrance to the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Euangeliſts.</p>
            <p>This doctrine is all that truth in the Canonicall ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, touching ſaluation by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>A ſumme and briefe of this doctrine, is that which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Apoſtles Creede. So ſaith S. Auguſtine, <hi>Ista verba quod audistis, per diuinas ſcripturas ſparſa ſunt. &amp;c. Theſe wordes which you haue heard, are ſtrawed all ouer the ſcriptures, but gathered together from thence, least the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of forgetfull parties ſhould faile, &amp; that euery man may haue what to ſay, and hold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wereuppon Marcellus in Epiphanius, repeating the Creede, faith he had it out of the diuine Scriptures.</p>
            <p>In which ſence, S. Auguſtine calleth it the foundation of the Catholique faith: &amp; S. Ambroſe, a key opening all the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>In conſidering of this Creede, it ſhall be good to know
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1866:76"/>the title, and the contents of it.</p>
            <p>The title is, <hi>The Apostles Creede.</hi> Wherein is the kinde of the thing, and the parties whoſe it is ſaid to be.</p>
            <p>The kind is, that it is a <hi>Creede.</hi> If we ſhould ſpeak to ſuch as vnderſtand Latine, it might not be vnfit to ſpeake of the Latine name, <hi>Symbolum.</hi> But heere it ſhall not need. Onely I thinke that diuers learned men are deceiued, who thinke that it is called <hi>ſymbolum,</hi> of part in a ſhot or reckoning, which diuers make vp. That (I take it) is <hi>ſymbola</hi> in the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine gender, not <hi>ſymbolum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This name of <hi>Creede,</hi> in Engliſh (I take it) aroſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the abuſe of the firſt word in Latine, <hi>Credo.</hi> Where, on theyr beades they were inioyned to ſay ſo many <hi>Auemaries, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternosters,</hi> and <hi>Credoes,</hi> wheron this was called <hi>creed.</hi> Which is a Latine word, and doth ſignifie as much to ſay, I belieue my creede, that is, that which I doe belieue: whereof vvee ſhall haue better cauſe to ſpeake by and by. So then <hi>the creede</hi> is that, which one by direction of the word of God, doth, and ought to belieue.</p>
            <p>The parties are <hi>the Apostles,</hi> whoſe it is ſaid to be. The Apoſtles are thoſe twelue, ſent out by GOD into all the world to preach the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Some thinke it is called theirs, as beeing in matter and forme penned by them, by diuine inſpiration, after the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt came vppon them, before they departed from Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem to preach the Goſpell. So as ſome ſet downe, what euery Apoſtle did ſet downe.</p>
            <p>This is not ſo, for then it were Canonicall Scripture, which it is not, for the Romaniſts themſelues graunt it to be but tradition.</p>
            <p>Others think, that it is ſaid to be the Apoſtles, as conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to theyr doctrine, as an abſtract &amp; abridgement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. So is it, though this be not all, for I iudge that this name is added, to put a difference betweene other formes of creeds vſed in the church, as the Nicene, <hi>I belieue in one God,</hi> Athanaſius, <hi>Whoſoeuer will be ſaued.</hi> Now for difference, this is called, <hi>the Apostles,</hi> as of their doctrine.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:77"/>
            <p> Now touching this title, ſome queſtions may be asked.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Que. What authoritie is this Creede of, diuine, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane? or how bindeth it?</p>
            <p>Aun. It is diuine for matter, though not for forme, for the Apoſtles did not pen it. And therefore ſo far bindeth, as it is agreeable to the Scriptures. And therefore, when a thing is ſaide to be as true as the Creede, it is onely for the matter.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Que. Whether all things to be knowne, neceſſarily to ſaluation, are contained heerein?</p>
            <p>Aun. I thinke they may be ſaid to be implied, though not expreſſed. And if God reueale, and giue meanes of knowledge of no more, theſe may ſuffice: otherwiſe not. Wee muſt belieue all that God will haue vs.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Que. vvhether is it certaine damnation not to beleeue euery of theſe?</p>
            <p>Aun. vvee muſt diſtinguiſh betweene articles of the foundation, and others. Articles of the foundation belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued may ſuffice, when others are not reuealed.</p>
            <p>Againe, we muſt conſider for articles or doctrines, not of the foundation, whether they be cleerely reuealed or not, if they be not, they ſhall not preiudice.</p>
            <p>Againe, whether wee erre of ſimplicitie or wilfulneſſe: vvilfull error damneth, ſimple doth not in things not of the foundation.</p>
            <p>Things of the foundation, I call faith and repentance, moſt neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Que. Are we bound to ſunder them into twelue?</p>
            <p>Aun. No. Remember that as God reuealeth, man muſt belieue.</p>
            <p>This for the title: the contents follow from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end.</p>
            <p>Theſe contents haue the profeſſion, the aſſent. Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in all to the particle <hi>Amen.</hi> Aſſent in the word <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the profeſſion, is the manner, and matter.</p>
            <p>The manner is, <hi>I beleeue.</hi> The matter, the reſt.</p>
            <p>Wherof before we can as we ſhould ſpeake of any, ſome
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1866:77"/>generall rules are to be remembred for all.</p>
            <p n="1">1 We muſt build our faith in euery of theſe points vpon the written word of GOD, not onely the wordes of this Creede, and therefore, Acts, 24, 14, Luke 24, 44, &amp; muſt vnderſtand all according to the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Euery one muſt make it for himſelfe, Iob, 19, 25, Gala, 2, 20, Iohn, 20, 28.</p>
            <p n="3">3 To euery clauſe, in heart this <hi>(I belieue)</hi> muſt be adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, though it be not expreſſed in word.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Wee muſt labour more and more to grow in fuller aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of euery parcell. Mar, 9, 24, Luke 17, 5.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Our life muſt be aunſwerable to the profeſſion of faith. Iames 2, 18. Therefore ſaith Irenaeus, <hi>to belieue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib, 4, 14.</note> 
               <hi>is to doe as God will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6 Though wee cannot diſſolue all doubts,
<note place="margin">Lib. 15, de trinitate capit, 2,</note> wee muſt not ſhrinke from the profeſſion. Firſt belieue, after you ſhall more and more vnderſtand. <hi>Faith ſeeketh,</hi> (ſaith S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine) <hi>vnderstanding ſindeth out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7 The Creede is no prayer.</p>
            <p>Hetherto the generall rules, the manner of profeſſion fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. <hi>I belieue.</hi> Whereof wee may conſider feuerally in it ſelfe, and ioyntly with the matter following. And firſt wee muſt conſider the groundes of ſcriptures, whereof in this point to belieue, and perſonally I belieue, wee may note theſe heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Commaundements to belieue. Iohn 20, 27.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Promiſes made to belieuers. Mar. 9, 23.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Rebuking of vnbeliefe. Math, 6, 30, Math, 8, 26, Math, 14, 31.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Commendation of parties for their beliefe ſake. Math, 8, 10, Math, 15, 28.</p>
            <p>Whereupon men are often noted by this in the New te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, that they are belieuers.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The meanes appointed by God to worke &amp; increaſe true faith, the worde and Sacraments, and euen the vvhole miniſterie.</p>
            <p>The ſame meanes are for perſonalitie, as I may call it.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:78"/>
            <p> Firſt therefore this <hi>I belieue,</hi> is that <hi>I haue beliefe.</hi> Beliefe is ſometime put for a thing which I doe belieue, ſometimes for a gift, whereby I doe belieue.</p>
            <p>For a thing which I doe belieue, as 1, Tim, 1, 19, Iude, 3,</p>
            <p>So is it not barely to be taken heere.</p>
            <p>For a gift whereby I doe beleeue. Mark, 9, 23.</p>
            <p>So is it taken heere, and thus doe I ſay, I belieue, as Philip, 1, 19.</p>
            <p>Now for the better vnderſtanding of this manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, wee muſt conſider, 1 what parties haue faith: 2 where faith is in ſuch parties as haue it. 3 vvhereabout faith is heſtowed, as about her proper matter. 4 vvhat be the parts thereof. 5 vvhat properties it hath. 6 &amp; laſtly how it is wrought.</p>
            <p>The parties who haue faith, are reaſonable: 1 God, who is ſaid to be faithful in keeping his promiſe. This to belieue, is to belieue a promiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Creatures. 1 Angels: 2 Men. In mankinde infants haue not faith.</p>
            <p>So as deuils haue a kind of faith. Neuertheleſſe, there is difference of Angels and deuils faith, and mens.</p>
            <p>Angels faith is in God the Creator, legall, no other then Adams was. Mens faith muſt be likewiſe in the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Angels are not properly ſaid to be redeemed, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed by Chriſt, as ſome Diuines hold.</p>
            <p>Deuils faith is onely of the truth and power of God in generall, out of themſelues.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond point, faith is ſaid to be in the hart. Rom. 10.9, 10. Acts, 8, 37. Ephe. 3, 17.</p>
            <p>Now ſo is it ſaid to be in the hart, as to be conueied into the whole man, eſpecially into the chiefe powers of the ſoule.</p>
            <p>Whereof the one is the minde, the other is the will. In both which I doe iudge that this faith is. All agree for the minde, ſome doubt for the will, which may thus be proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Firſt, becauſe it is ſaid to be in the hart, which impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the whole ſoule.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:1866:78"/>
            <p> Secondly, for that faith knitteth to God. Thirdly, fayth and hope differ not (I take it) in place, hope is an affection.</p>
            <p>This is moſt certaine, that euery one who belieueth, muſt doe it with his hart: Yea, with all his hart.</p>
            <p>The proper matter which faith regardeth, is the vvhole word of God, as God reuealeth it. And therefore, before the word was written, fayth was bounde to belieue diuine viſions, dreames, and ſpeciall promiſes of Gods ſpeciall power, whence did ariſe faith to worke wonders, vvhen there is no ſuch ſpeciall promiſe, that faith ceaſeth.</p>
            <p>Since the word is written, it is tied to that in the right meaning of it, and to that onely.</p>
            <p>The parts of faith, are knowledge, and application.</p>
            <p>For knowledge, the ſcripture is plentifull.</p>
            <p>Whereuppon, faith is ſometimes called wiſedome, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This knowledge is perceiuing of that which I doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue.</p>
            <p>And hath two parts, notice, and aſſent.</p>
            <p>Notice is the perceiuing of the meaning of the thing. Which can neuer heere in this life be full in vs, and is not to be vnderſtood, as ſome preciſely ſpeake, of knowing to be by cauſes.</p>
            <p>To this notice is required alwaies: 1 Some direction &amp; warrant of ſcripture.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Meaning of the words, and matter belieued.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Diſcerning truth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falſhood. Ioh, 10, 4, 14, 16, 1, Cor, 2, 14, Phil, 1, 10, Heb, 5, 14.</p>
            <p>Whereupon foloweth, a light to try and examine things by.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Abilitie to increaſe therein by the right vſe of former knowledge.</p>
            <p n="5">5 To be able to teach others that which our ſelues know.</p>
            <p>Aſſent, is perſwaſion of the certaintie of the truth of the former euery way, whereof wee haue notice. Iohn, 21, 24. 2, Pet, 1, 16, 17. 2, Tim, 1, 12.</p>
            <p>This is called Plerophorie, or full aſſurance that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
<pb facs="tcp:1866:79"/>is falſe, in aſſurance whereof, a belieuer wil ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any thing rather then to deny.</p>
            <p>Whereupon faith alwaies ſtriueth againſt doubting.</p>
            <p>Of theſe two alone, ariſeth that which is called hiſtoricall fayth, that is, a belieuing of the hiſtory of the Bible.</p>
            <p>Application is, whereby the belieuer is perſwaded, that the thing belieued, belongeth to him, in euery poynt as it is knowne and aſſented vnto.</p>
            <p>This is the hardeſt in tentations, and is moſt aſſailed, by the deuill, by the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore let vs prooue this.</p>
            <p>The Papiſtes ſo miſlike application in fayth in generall, as that they denie that application is in iuſtifying faith. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: de iuſtificat: lib. 1.30.</hi> Inſomuch as he ſayth, eleuen ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Creede, belong onely to credultie, that is, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to belieue, not to affiance.</p>
            <p>Wee prooue it thus: 1 Where particuler mercies are promiſed, there muſt be particuler faith.</p>
            <p>But to diuers in ſcriptures are particuler promiſes, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Math, 9, 2. Luke, 7, 48, &amp;c, therefore.</p>
            <p>They aunſwere to the minor, theſe parties were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and had indeed ſpeciall reuelation.</p>
            <p>We aunſwer, that as true as Chriſtes word was to them, ſo is his Spirit now vnto his children, ſo as they ought not to diſtruſt it. Neither doth Paule ſpeake, Rom, 8, 38, 39, more of himſelfe then of vs</p>
            <p>That Gods Spirit witneſſeth with ours, it is euident. Rom. 8, 16. Gala, 4, 6. 2, Cor, 1, 21, 22. Ephe, 1, 13, Ioh, 1, 2, 27.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In all faith, there is as it were a ſyllogiſme made, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the minor is with application.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Particuler perſons are rebuked for infidelitie.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Practiſes of particular parties, Thomas, Iohn, 20, 28, Dauid, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Fathers are large heere. <hi>Qui de Deo non praeſumit ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam, non animaduertit, plus peccato ſuo poſſe Dei clementiam. August: Whoſoeuer doth not preſume of pardon from GOD, doth not conſider that the mercy of God can do more then his ſin.

            <p>So therefore is faith with application, as euery branch to ſaluation hath it.</p>
            <p>Heereof are theſe degrees: 1 Approbation, whereby one is perſwaded of the woorth of the doctrine to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Expedition, whereby one deſireth it aboue any thing.</p>

            <p n="5">5 Expectation, looking for the benefit thereof.</p>
            <p>This with the former, is the faith of Gods elect, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the learned called iuſtifiying, or ſauing fayth.</p>
            <p>The properties of faith may eaſily be perceiued, euen by that faith is ſaid to be in the hart.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It will profeſſe or confeſſe it ſelfe when occaſion ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. Rom: 10, 9, 2, Cor, 4, 13.</p>
            <p>We muſt be ready heereunto.</p>
            <p>But heere a queſtion or two may be demaunded, 1 Que. How far is a partie bound alwaies to make profeſſion of his faith?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:80"/>
            <p> Aun. Profeſſion may be ſaid to be in deed, or words.</p>
            <p>In deedes, when wee leade a life according to the doctrine of faith. This kinde of profeſſion muſt alwaies be, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where.</p>
            <p>In word, when wee giue out what we hold and belieue. And this may be conſidered in matters that are of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of ſaluation, or acceſſary, and not of the foundation.</p>
            <p>In ſuch things as are not of the foundation, wee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, 1 order, to doe that after things of the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: 2 our calling, to deale in ſuch matters, as if we be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, 3 to take the fit ſeaſon for hearers.</p>
            <p>For ſuch things as are of the foundation: 1 Wee muſt neuer deny any of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2 When we are called vpon by lawfull authorie, we muſt profeſſe our faith.</p>
            <p>Heere ſome exception may be, if it be before ſcoffers, Chriſt held his peace.</p>
            <p n="3">3 VVee muſt ſpeake ſo as men may perceiue our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, we muſt not affect doubtfull ſpeeches.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Though we be not demaunded, if our ſilence ſhould be very hurtfull, or our profeſſion profitable, we muſt make profeſſion.</p>
            <p>A ſecond queſtion, whether it be lawfull to compell to make profeſſion?</p>
            <p>Aun. Wee muſt diſtinguiſh the parties towards whom compulſion is vſed. For if they be ſuch as neuer had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor made profeſſion of the truth, they muſt not be compelled firſt, but taught.</p>
            <p>Why then are Papiſts puniſhed? Aun. Some are puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for theyr treaſons, others for theyr refuſing to be taught.</p>
            <p>If they haue made profeſſion, and ſtande not to it, they muſt be compelled. None muſt be ſuffered to profeſſe a falſe doctrine, vnpuniſhed, or vnnoted.</p>

            <p>How far may a Soueraigne proceede in puniſhing, for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1866:80"/>not profeſſing the faith?</p>
            <p>Hee muſt make lawes for the keeping of the Catholique faith, any teaching idolatry wilfully, hee ought to puniſh with death.</p>
            <p>Whether may a Prince ſuffer the Ambaſſadour of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Prince, to vſe his conſcience?</p>
            <p>Aun. I thinke he may, becauſe he hath no authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him, not being his ſoueraigne: but none of his owne ſubiects muſt be permitted to communicate with him in falſe worſhip.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ſecond property is, that faith is explicit, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to beleeue as the Church beleeueth, but to ſay what wee beleeue, why we beleeue, what we meane by that which we ſay we beleeue.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The third, that it is liuely and formed. No true faith is dead. Charity is not the forme of faith.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The fourth, it can neuer be loſt, if it be rooted, and confirmed.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The fift, according to the doctrine it belieueth, it muſt be taken diuerſly, and therefore it is ſometimes to belieue, ſometimes to belieue in.</p>
            <p>Faith is wrought effectually by the holy Ghoſt, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally by the word.</p>
            <p>Hetherto haue we ſpoken of the manner of this profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in generall, and ſeuerally in it ſelfe: now followeth that we conſider it with application, to euery branch following.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, as euery one of diſcretion muſt belieue, ſo muſt they in God, &amp; ſo the reſt following: ſecondly from the hart: thirdly, according to diuine truth written. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we muſt know grounds of ſcripture for euery one, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the meaning thereof, perceiue the difference, from others, be able to teach them to others, apply them to our ſelues. Fiftly, profeſſe them in due time, expreſſe them, &amp; laſtly, our faith muſt be liuely.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the manner of profeſſion: the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and matter profeſſed foloweth, beginning at <hi>in God,</hi> and ſo on to <hi>life euerlasting.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:81"/>
            <p> The matter hath two parts, 1 <hi>of God.</hi> 2 <hi>of the Church.</hi> Of God, to <hi>I belieue the holy Catholique, &amp;c.</hi> excluſiuely of the Church in the reſt.</p>
            <p>This of God is eſſentially and generally, or perſonall, &amp; particularly.</p>
            <p>Of God eſſentially, in name, or attributes. Name, <hi>in God.</hi>

            <p>Neither is this onely true in generall, but alſo in ſpeciall, and particuler: ſo Exod, 3, 6.</p>
            <p>So God promiſeth, Gene, 17, 2, no more to Abraham then others, Rom: 4. For Abraham is father of the faithful. Thus did Daniel, 6, 23, Paule, Acts, 27, 25. Dauid, Pſalm. 22, 1.</p>

            <p>This forme in generall is ſet downe, Ierem, 31.</p>
            <p>In particuler, Gene, 17, 2.</p>
            <p>In this couenant is a promiſe and commaundement.</p>
            <p>Promiſe on Gods part, that he will be our God, as Gen, 17, 1, Gene, 1, 11, where are promiſed all things to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, full and for euer.</p>
            <p>So as if we tell him of our loſſe, hee will reſtore it, of out ſicknes, he is phiſitian, of death, he is our rayſer.</p>
            <p>In particuler, God promiſeth: 1 To teach vs all things neceſſarily to be knowne of vs: <hi>They ſhall be taught of God.</hi> Looke Eſay, 30, 21.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Memorandum</hi> that this article profeſſeth the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt therefore euery one diſavoweth all Atheiſme.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Belieueth in God as the ſcriptures reueale.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Acknowledge but one God.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Who knoweth whatſoeuer they doe. 5 Is preſent to them. 6 True of his promiſe made. Whereby they ſeeke vnto him: reſt in his iudgment of them: are perſwaded that all thinges ſhall worke for theyr good heere, and that GOD ſhall be full, and for euer happineſſe vnto them, ſo as they make him theyr portion aboue all other things.</p>
            <p>Thus farre touching GOD by Name, nowe follow the attributes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:82"/>
            <p> Ob. The Father is firſt named, therfore ſhould it be firſt opened.</p>
            <p>Aun. So might it. Neuertheleſſe, ſeeing that attributes are of the eſſence, and Father is a perſon, and eſſence for ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie teaching ſhould goe firſt, therefore we may without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence (not blaming the order of the Creede) ſpeake firſt of the attributes. Theſe rules muſt be remembred of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Though heere they be ioyned with the Father, that is but for orders ſake, they belong likewiſe to the Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, and ſo muſt be remembred.</p>
            <p n="2">2 There are more belonging to God, and to be belieued in God then theſe. Looke Exod, 34, 6.</p>
            <p>The attributes heere are two, <hi>Almighty, and maker of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Que: Why are theſe named, and no more?</p>
            <p>Aun. Theſe are named, 1 as beeing very well knowne euen to ſome of the heathen, <hi>Giue mee</hi> (ſaith S. Auguſtine) <hi>a Pagan, a worſhipper of many Idols, a ſeruaunt of deuils, who ſaith not that God is almightie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Plato could ſee that the world was made.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Theſe put a manifeſt difference betweene the true and falſe god. God himſelfe by his power, proueth himſelf to be the true God. So doth Elias co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince the people, 1, Kin: 18, 24, 34, 38: and for making the world, looke Iere: 10, 11, and Auguſtine, <hi>Let any make a world, and he ſhall be God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 Theſe are of ſpeciall vſe for fayth and life.</p>
            <p>Que: Is there any thing in the order that theſe are heere named?</p>
            <p>Aun: The creation prooueth the almightines of God. There are heere no more then theſe named, for ſhortneſſe ſake, and memory.</p>
            <p>Now for the grounds of this article, 1 Conſider the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall promiſe, 2, Cor, 6, 18.</p>
            <p>More ſpecially applied, Exod, 6, 3.</p>
            <p>To Abraham, Gene, 17, 1.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Where the almighty is prayed vnto, there muſt be faith, he is prayed vnto, Gene, 28, 3, Gene, 43, 14.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:1866:82"/> 3 The practiſe of Gods children was thus to belieue in the almighty. Paul, 2, Cor, 6, 18, the three men, Dan, 3, 17.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Vnbeliefe in this kinde is puniſhed in Zachary, Luk, 1, 20, in the Prince, 2, Kings, 7, 17, in Benhadaes ſeruaunts, 1, Kings, 20, 28.</p>
            <p>That God is almighty, it needeth not to be proued, yet to ſatisfie ſuch as are ignorant, this may ſerue.</p>
            <p>Namely, the conſideration of the ſundry mighty works of God, generall, particuler. He is the <hi>God of hostes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this article wee may conſider the meaning, and the duties which we profeſſe.</p>
            <p>The meaning may eaſily appeare in the name <hi>Almightie,</hi> which is, who hath all might.</p>
            <p>Might in God, is whereby hee is of power, and can doe things.</p>
            <p>This might and power, is abſolute, or actuall.</p>
            <p>Abſolute power in God, is whereby hee can doe more then he will, as Math, 3, 9, to raiſe vp of ſtones children to Abraham. To giue Chriſt more then legions of angels, which he would not.</p>
            <p>Actuall power is that whereby God doth what hee will.</p>
            <p>Queſt: Whether of the two powers is meant heere?</p>
            <p>Aun. Wee muſt belieue both. Neuertheleſſe, actuall is that which more neerly concerneth vs, wherein wee can haue comfort in. Of this it is ſaid, Pſalm, 115, 3, <hi>And hee ſpake the word, and they were made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God is ſaid to be thus <hi>Almightie,</hi> 1 Dooing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he will: and heere Gods omnipotencie is not in doing ſinne: Sin hee willeth not. Againe, ſin is of weakenes, not of ſtrength.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Hindering what he willeth.</p>
            <p>Obiect: Why doth he not then hinder ſin?</p>
            <p>Aun: Becauſe he is not bound ſo to doe: 2 for that hee can bring out of ſinne, good.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Dooing all things with eaſe: hee but willeth, and they are.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Cauſing all power where it is, euen making weake
<pb facs="tcp:1866:83"/>ſtrong. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus farre for the meaning, the duties remaine which we doe profeſſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Neuer to preſume of the Almighty power of God for vs, vnleſſe wee know his will to that end. For though our faith beleeueth, he can doe more then he will, yet we neuer can reape comfort of his power diſioyned from his will. So as Romaine Catholiques not prouing Gods will for tranſubſtantiation, ſay nothing to purpoſe. Or looſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors reſting on Gods power, as able to conuert them, and not vſing meanes, doe but beguile themſelues.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Neuer to doubt, but whatſoeuer God will, ſhall ſurely come to paſſe, promiſed, threatned, generally, particulerly.</p>
            <p>Obiect. May one then neglect meanes? Aunſwer. No. They ſerue for Gods Almightines to worke by, &amp; in deede in the moſt vſuall we may eaſily perceaue Gods power.</p>
            <p n="3">3 To renounce all truſt in creatures.</p>
            <p n="4">4 To truſt wholy in God. 2. Cor. 1, 9.2, Cor. 12, 9. Eph. 6, 10.</p>
            <p n="5">5 To be ſtrong in faith. Rom. 4, 21.</p>
            <p n="6">6 To be aſſured of the performance of our prayers.</p>
            <p n="7">7 To haue contentation in God. 2, Cor. 9, 7. Heb. 13, 5. For indeede God ſo promiſeth to be to vs. Gen. 15, 1.</p>
            <p n="8">8 In what eſtate ſo euer we be, to reioyce in God. Pſal. 46 Iob, 22, 25, 26.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the former attribute, the latter followeth, <hi>Maker of heauen and earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſpeaking whereof, we may conſider it ioyned with the reſt, and in it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>As it is ioyned with the reſt, firſt why at all it is ſet down.</p>
            <p>Aun. I take it againſt the poyſon of Marcions hereſie, who thought it not meete to beleeue in God the maker of the world: vvhereas the ſcriptures though teach ſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</p>
            <p>It is ſet in this order after the former, as a proofe thereof. For the maker of heauen and earth cannot chooſe but be Almighty.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:1866:83"/>
            <p> In it ſelfe marke three things, the grounds of ſcripture, the meaning, the things profeſſed.</p>
            <p>The grounds of ſcriptures are, 1 Gods making of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thus knowne. Hier. 10, 11. Eſa, 45, 7. Eſa, 66, 2, Acts. 7, 50.</p>
            <p>He is ſo prayed vnto, Act, 4, 24.</p>
            <p>So beleeued in, Pſal. 124, 8.</p>
            <p>So profeſſed. Ier. 32, 17.</p>
            <p>By this name and title praiſed. Pſal. 136, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>So as S. Auguſtine ſaith, <hi>Let any creature that you will come and make a world, and I will ſay it is God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus is God preached to be beleeued in, Act, 17, 23.24. Act, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>This for the grounds of ſcripture.</p>
            <p>The meaning will appeare by the words, where the cauſe is ioyned with the effect. The cauſe, <hi>Maker,</hi> the effect, <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maker</hi> in the ſcriptures is properly called Creator.</p>
            <p>Creator is who did create. Create is to make of nothing.</p>
            <p n="1">1 This God did.</p>
            <p n="2">2 By his commaundement.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Not all things together, but in ſixe dayes.</p>
            <p n="4">4 When time began, ſo as there are not yet 6000. yeeres, ſince the world began.</p>
            <p n="5">5 So as that he ruleth and gouerneth otherwiſe then A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſts thinke.</p>
            <p>God ruleth and gouerneth for euer.</p>
            <p>Gods ruling or gouerning is his prouidence.</p>
            <p>Prouidence is either generall or ſpeciall.</p>
            <p>Generall prouidence, is whereby all things ioyntly are ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; ſuch there is.</p>
            <p>Particuler is whereby euery ſeuerall is ruled, eſpecially &amp; moſt choiſely, man. As to the lighting of a ſparrowe vpon the ground, to the number of our haires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O thou omnipotent</hi> (ſaith S. Auguſtine) <hi>who rulest all as one, and one as if he were alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The effect is, <hi>Heauen and earth.</hi> Where, by a manner of
<pb facs="tcp:1866:84"/>ſpeech when that which containeth is put for the contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, all things are meant, all being contained in heauen and earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heauen</hi> is all from the face of the earth vpward.</p>
            <p>There are three heauens
<list>
                  <item>ayrie.</item>
                  <item>ſtarrie.</item>
                  <item>glorious.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The ayrie heauen is from the face of the earth, to the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt part of the ſphere of the Moone. Wherein are fowles, meteors, as winde, raine, ſnow, haile, thunder, lightning.</p>
            <p>The ſtarry is from the Moone vpward, as farre as motion goeth. Wherein are the ſtarres fixed, or planets, the diuers motions, the influences.</p>
            <p>The glorious heauen is aboue all motion, where the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Trinity doth moſt appeare. There is the humane nature of Chriſt, the ſoules of the elect departed this life, the bleſſed Angels miniſtring.</p>
            <p>Theſe Angels were created.</p>
            <p>They are miniſtring ſpyrits for the neceſſities of the Church.</p>
            <p>The earth is put for the earth and water together, from the face of it to the centre and middle.</p>
            <p>In the water are fiſhes, pearles, in the earth are mettals, diuers kinds of precious earth, ſtones, &amp;c, on the earth are beaſts and cattell, but eſpecially man. All creatures haue ſome print or <hi>vestigium</hi> of God, man hath Gods image.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Now all theſe things are good, Gen. 1, 31.</p>
            <p>Obiect: Some things are hurtfull to vs. Aun: They are of very good vſe, being applied by God.</p>
            <p>Queſt. Whence commeth euill? Aun. By the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the reaſonable creatures to God.</p>
            <p>Obiect. God maketh euill. Aun: Of puniſhment, not of fault.</p>
            <p n="2">2 All theſe make but one world.</p>
            <p>Queſt. What ſay you of the deuils? Aun. God made them at the firſt good ſpirits, but they haue left their firſt beginning. For their ſubſtance they are good, not in their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1866:84"/>qualities.</p>
            <p>This is the meaning, the duties profeſſed remaine.</p>
            <p>They are of two ſorts, either in reſpect of the creation, or prouidence.</p>
            <p>In reſpect of the creation, 1 That wee belieue that the world was ordained by the word, &amp;c. Heb, 11, 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That ſeeing the creatures were made by GOD, wee ought to meditate of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3 By the creatures to riſe more to the knowledge of God. Pſalm, 19, 1, Rom, 1, 25.</p>
            <p n="4">4 From the conſideration of the creation, to get increaſe of faith, for perſwaſion of performance of our prayers. Act. 4, 24.</p>
            <p n="5">5 To praiſe God, Pſalm, 136, 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="6">6 To conſider of our owne ſoule and body: Looke pſal, 139, 13, 14. and Iob, 10, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>Thus much for duties profeſſed in reſpect of the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, duties in reſpect of prouidence follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That we acknowledge all things to be moſt wiſely ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That he hath particular care of vs.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That the Angels watch about vs.</p>
            <p n="4">4 All the creatures ſhall worke for our good. Iob, 5, 22, 23.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Be contented with whatſoeuer God doth.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Vſe not the name of fortune, lucke, chaunce.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Tempt not God by neglect of meanes.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Remember, Iam, 4, 15.</p>
            <p>Hetherto touching God eſſentially, now followeth of him perſonally.</p>
            <p>Whatſoeuer is ſaid of God in generall in this Creede, or in the ſcriptures, is true of euery perſon: the Father onely is not Creator and almighty, but ſo likewiſe is the Sonne, and holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>It may be obiected, that the Sonne doth nothing of him ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Aun. True, not without the Father, but all with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb facs="tcp:1866:85"/>2 Not in the ſence the Iewes conceiued of him, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him for a bare man, ſo he doth nothing.</p>
            <p>Que. Why are theſe aſcribed to the Father?</p>
            <p>Aun. Onely for order.</p>
            <p>Of God perſonally it is ſaid, that he is <hi>Father, Sonne, &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost.</hi> Firſt is <hi>Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Father is a name that cannot be vnderſtood without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to child, or ſonne.</p>
            <p>God is father of a ſonne who is GOD, or of ſonnes who are men.</p>
            <p>To vnderſtand God the father, of a ſonne who is God, ſomewhat muſt be touched, concerning the miſterie of the Trinitie.</p>
            <p>There is (as was ſaid before) but one God. There are 3. perſons, Father, Sonne, holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>A perſon is a manner of beeing in the God-head, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by an incommunicable propertie.</p>
            <p>The perſons be coequall, and coeternall.</p>
            <p>The Father is of none.</p>
            <p>The Sonne is begotten of the Father.</p>
            <p>The holy Ghoſt proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Father and the Son. The Sonne may be conſidered, as not incarnate, and nowe incarnate. Not incarnate, he was called the Word, incarnat, the ſonne of man.</p>
            <p>In reſpect of his perſon and manhood, hee is the Sonne of God.</p>
            <p>To vnderſtand God the Father of ſonnes who are men, ſomewhat muſt be touched concerning the miſtery of our redemption and adoption.</p>
            <p>Of mankinde, which might haue periſhed by the fall of Adam, it pleaſed God in Chriſt, to adopt and make ſome to be ſonnes vnto himſelfe, Ephe: 1, 5, Iohn, 1, 12.</p>
            <p>Que: It may be demaunded, whether wee muſt belieue in God the Father of Chriſt, or our father, or both?</p>
            <p>Aun. Both. So ſaith Chriſt: your father, my father. Praying, himſelfe calleth father, and teacheth vs ſo to pray: Our Father.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:1866:85"/>
            <p> Let vs then conſider the grounds of ſcriptures, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this article, and what we doe therein profeſſe.</p>
            <p>But becauſe there be two branches implied, firſt conſider of the firſt, then of the latter.</p>
            <p>And that wee ought to belieue in the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, it appeareth, for that God himſelfe, maketh himſelfe knowne by that name. Math, 3, 17, Luke, 3, 22, Heb, 1, 5.</p>
            <p>He is prayſed vnder that title, 2, Cor. 1, 3, Ephe, 1, 3. Chriſt promiſeth, Iohn, 14, 23. Is prayed vnto, Ephe, 3, 14.</p>
            <p>The meaning heereof is, that I acknowledge to belieue in that God, who is the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And heereby doe diſavow all Turkiſh, Iewiſh doctrine, which holdeth not the doctrine of the bleſſed Trinitie.</p>
            <p>Now for belieuing in God who is my Father; God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth himſelfe ſo to be, 2, Cor, 6, 18, Iere, 31, 1, more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, Exod, 4, 22, 23.</p>
            <p>God commaundeth ſo to be called vpon, Iere, 3, 19.</p>
            <p>And findeth fault that any other ſhould be ſo called, Iere, 2, 27, Math, 23, 9.</p>
            <p>Chriſt himſelfe applyeth this name. Math, 6, 8, 14, 15, 18, and that very particularly, Math, 6, 18.</p>
            <p>Thus did the godly, Eſay 63, 162 So are we taught, Mat, 6, 6. Luke 11, 2.</p>
            <p>I meane then, that I know the doctrine of adoption, &amp; am perſwaded that it belongeth to me.</p>
            <p>I know it, when I know whence I am redeemed, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie from miſery, for whom I am adopted, namely for Chriſt, how I am aſſured heereof, to wit, by faith.</p>
            <p>I profeſſe in this branch, 1 To make more account of this, that God is my father in Chriſt, then of all thinges in the world beſide.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To looke for all fauours from God, as a Father, beeing now made a ſonne of his.</p>
            <p>The firſt fauour is Gods ſparing, as a father is wont to doe, Mala, 3, 17.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:86"/>
            <p> This is in 1 not imputing faults, 2 not inflicting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, 3 moderatly and gently chaſtiſing, 4 in taking in good worth the weakenes and vnperfectnes of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Hence muſt needes ariſe great peace of conſcience, and ioy in the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is the Spirit of adoption, whereby wee crie Abba, father.</p>
            <p>This Spirit, 1 hath boldnes to come into the preſence of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Ability or gift, to poure forth prayers and deſires and prayſes.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Perſwaſion, that al are heard and accepted of God.</p>
            <p>The third is, his care to prouide things neceſſary for vs, 2, Cor, 12, 14, Math, 6, 32, Pſal, 23,</p>
            <p>From hence we haue that, 1 which is enough.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Where-with wee are contented, 3 That which God bleſſeth, as the womans oyle, the Iewes apparell.</p>
            <p>The fourth is his defence of vs.</p>
            <p>Keeping vs from euill.</p>
            <p>Deliuering out of euill.</p>
            <p>The fift, title to the creatures, which we loſt by the fall of Adam.</p>
            <p>The ſixt, certainty of inheritance in heauen. All mens children are not heires, but Gods are, and fellow heires with Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3 I profeſſe to performe all duties to God, as a child to a father.</p>
            <p>For there is no benefit, but requireth a duty.</p>
            <p>All the duties which wee owe to God, or can performe, are honour. Exod, 20, 3, Mal, 1, 6.</p>
            <p>This honour may be conſidered in reſpect of God, our ſelues, and others.</p>
            <p>In reſpect of God, we ought,</p>
            <p n="1">1 To acknowledge this our being ſonnes, is meerely of grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To ſeeke to God in all our wants.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:1866:86"/> 3 To thanke him for all fauours, 4 To take all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p n="5">5 To obey his commaundements.</p>
            <p n="6">6 At his corrections to acknowledge our faults, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend.</p>
            <p>In reſpect of our ſelues, remember whence we came into this fauour, to carry our ſelues humbly, all the time of our liues.</p>
            <p>In reſpect of others who are without, and haue not yet giuen their names to Chriſt, wee muſt doe nothing to the ſhaming of our houſe and father, but all things to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:</p>
            <p>Who are of the Church, all of vs hauing one father, to be one to other brother and ſiſter.</p>
            <p>Hitherto of the firſt perſon, the ſecond followeth to, <hi>I beleeue in the holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the doctrine touching the ſecond perſon, wee may ſpeake of it ioyned with the former, and in it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>It is ioyned with this word, <hi>and.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And,</hi> ſheweth that it goeth with the reſt, and in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>It goeth with the reſt, as may appeare euery where in ſcripture, ſo as that it is not enough to beleeue in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>The order is, that it followeth the former, not for any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthines it hath in reſpect of the former, but for that ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what muſt goe firſt, and the Father being the firſt in order, the doctrine touching him muſt be ſo, and againe the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Chriſt being cleerely manifeſted after that of the Father, it is not without iuſt cauſe ſet after it.</p>
            <p>Thus much as it is ioyned with the former, as it is in it ſelfe, it is concerning <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> &amp;c, more largely ſette downe then any other doctrine in the creede.</p>
            <p>Whereby is declared vnto vs, that as we ſhould make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all other ſo of this in more ſpeciall ſort. Hence it is, 1, Cor, 2, 2, Philip. 3 7, 8, 1, Cor, 16, 22.</p>
            <p>In it ſelfe it is from this <hi>in Ieſus Christ,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p n="7">7 Paul and Silas particulerly ſpeake, Act, 16, 31,</p>
            <p n="8">8 He is in that name prayed vnto.</p>
            <p>This name <hi>Ieſus</hi> is a broken Hebrew word of <hi>Iehoſuang,</hi> thus written &amp; pronounced in Greeke, for that the Greeke tongue hath no aſpiration in the middle of words.</p>
            <p>This name hath in it (as Chriſoſtome ſaith) a 1000 trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries of good things, and is (as Bernard ſaith) <hi>honey in the mouth, muſicke in the eare, a ioyfull ſhowte in the heart.</hi>

            <p>In delight, wherein Genebrard obſerueth, that Paul vſeth it fiue hundreth times in his Epiſtles.</p>
            <p>Yet for all that, we muſt take heede we doe not abuſe it.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To make it a word of wonder, as ſome doe, Ieſu.</p>

            <p>Aun: The meaning is, that Ieſus is the true God, and that all creatures ſhould be ſubiect to him, as to the Father. Name is for perſon, bowing the knee, a bodily ceremonie, to expreſſe inward ſubiection.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Not to make it a name of ſect, or order, as thoſe haue done, who call themſelues of the ſocietie of Ieſus, or Ieſuits.</p>

            <p>He is, who recouereth out of miſerable eſtate, ſetteth in happy, and keepeth therein.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:1866:88"/>by Eſay, 61, 1, expounded by Peter. Act, 3, 22, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by Chriſt, Luk, 4, 21,</p>

            <p n="6">6 God threatneth if we refuſe, Deut. 18, 15, 19,</p>
            <p n="7">7 Peter is highly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended for thus beleeuing, Math: 16, 17.</p>

            <p>It is to be ioyned with Ieſus, not to be ſet alone. It is not enough to beleeue in Chriſt, we muſt beleeue in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. The Iewes beleeue in a Chriſt after a ſort. Therefore are both ioyned, Act, 2, 36, Luk, 2, 26, 27.</p>
            <p>It is to be reade not only and barely <hi>Christ, but the Christ,</hi> as if it had an article notificatiue.</p>
            <p>Such an eſpeciall one looked the Iewes for, Ioh, 1, 41, and Ioh, 4, 25, Math, 16, 16, 17,</p>
            <p>The ſignification appeareth by the right knowledge of the name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christ</hi> is a Greeke word, and ſignifieth <hi>anointed.</hi> It is as much as the Hebrew <hi>Meſſms.</hi>

            <p n="3">3 Workes.</p>

            <p n="4">4 Adoration proper to God.</p>
            <p>It may be obiected, that Chriſt is a creature, becauſe he is
<pb facs="tcp:1866:90"/>called firſt begotten of creatures, Colo, 1, 19.</p>
            <p>Aun: He is before all creatures, that is the meaning, to whom right ouer them doth belong.</p>
            <p>And whereas, Gala, 4, 4, it is ſaide hee was made of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, it is meant according to his fleſh.</p>
            <p>So are many places to be vnderſtood.</p>
            <p>Neither is it true onely that Chriſt is God, but it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that ſo he ſhould be.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Elſe he could not ſaue, Eſay, 43, 11.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Vnleſſe he were infinite, he could not beare the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wrath of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It increaſeth his merits. Otherwiſe he could haue but deſerued for himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The ſcriptures did ſo foretell.</p>
            <p n="5">5 It was the beſt way to ſet out the loue of God.</p>
            <p>Thus for that Chriſt is God: now foloweth that hee is a diſtinct perſon from the Father, as may appeare, Math, 3, 16, 17, Math, 28, 19, 1, Iohn, 5, 7.</p>
            <p>It followeth, <hi>onely begotten.</hi> Iohn, 1, 14, and Iohn, 3, 18, 1, Iohn, 4, 9. Somewheres he is called firſt begotten. Aun. Looke a little before.</p>
            <p>He is onely begotten in reſpect of the Father &amp; diuine nature, he is firſt begotten is reſpect of his mother, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature.</p>

            </p>
            <p>He is begotten of the Father, Pſal, 2, 7, Heb, 1, 5.</p>
            <p>Obiect. God is not begotten, Chriſt is God. Therfore not begotten.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The perſon GOD the Father, begetteth the perſon the Sonne God. So is Chriſt God of himſelfe, Sonne of the Father, as Gregory of Valence, &amp; Bellarmin confeſſe that Caluin truly thinketh.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:1866:90"/>
            <p> Queſt. How is this Sonne begotten?</p>
            <p>Aun. I cannot tell, and I would wiſh you not to ſeeke, adore this miſterie.</p>
            <p>He hath the whole eſſence communicated to him.</p>
            <p>Que. When was he begotten? An. Before all worlds.</p>
            <p>He is alone.</p>
            <p>Obiect: God hath other ſonnes.</p>
            <p>Aun. By fauour, not nature.</p>
            <p>This name implieth partaking all the eſſence, the whole loue and counſell of God. Therefore is he ſaid to be in the Fathers boſome. Ioh. 1, 18.</p>
            <p>Hitherto the meaning, the things profeſſed remaine.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That Chriſt in whom I beleeue, is true God, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then the Iewes, who iudge him a man.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That Chriſt is a diſtinct perſon from the Father.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That God the Father loueth mee wonderfull well, Ioh, 3, 16.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That vnleſſe I beleeue in him, I ſhall be damned.</p>
            <p n="5">5 If I beleeue, I ſhall be ſafe, Ioh, 3, 36.</p>
            <p n="6">6 That God giuing his Sonne, will giue all things with him, Rom, 8, 32,</p>
            <p n="7">7 That all the good I haue, is by meanes of the Sonne of God.</p>
            <p>The latter remaineth, <hi>our Lord.</hi> For the which are grounds of ſcripture.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Pſal. 110, 1, interpreted and applied by Chriſt, Math: 22, 43, 44, 45.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In this name doth Daniel pray, 9, 17.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Thus hath God ordained, Act, 2, 36,</p>
            <p n="4">4 So doe the Apoſtles euery where write, 2, Cor, 4, 5,</p>
            <p n="5">5 To this end did God, Phil: 2, 9, 10, 11,</p>
            <p n="6">6 In ſo much as Paule highly preferreth this, Phil: 3, 8, and denounceth an horrible curſe to the contrary, 1, Cor. 16, 22.</p>
            <p n="7">7 In particular did apply this to themſelues, Dauid, Pſal. 110, 1. Mary, Ioh: 20, 13, Thomas, Ioh: 20, 28, Paul, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip 3, 8.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:91"/>
            <p> The meaning we ſhall beſt vnderſtand, if we remember, that.</p>
            <p n="1">1 This muſt be ioyned with that which goeth before, and followeth.</p>
            <p>In ſo much as Chriſt after an eſpeciall manner, is called the Lord.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Conſider the words in which the relation is, <hi>our Lord: Lord</hi> and <hi>our.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord</hi> in ſcripture is taken 3 wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Eſſentially, ſo is it with Iehouah. As in the tranſlation of the old Teſtament.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Ciuilly for a name of reuerence. As Act, 16, 30, Lords or ſirs. And ſo it aunſwereth to <hi>Adonai.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Euery of theſe are true in Chriſt. Yet I thinke the laſt is chiefely meant, as he being the owner of vs all.</p>
            <p>Now Chriſt is ſo Lord, as the onely, 1, Cor, 8, 6, Eph, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>In ſo much, that whereas Suetonius obſerueth that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus refuſed the name of Lord, Oroſius noteth, that it was at the time when Chriſt was borne, that all Lordſhippe might be aſcribed vnto him.</p>
            <p>As euery way, ſo alſo for that hee ruleth in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Obiect: The Father and holy Ghoſt is Lord.</p>
            <p>Aun. True: but the Sonne is called for that all Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is committed to him to execute, and that he only doth it in the humaine nature.</p>
            <p>As Chriſt is onely Lord, ſo is he Lord of Lords, 1, Tim, 6, 15, Reuel: 17, 14,</p>
            <p>He is ſaid to be <hi>our</hi> Lord: <hi>our</hi> who profeſſe this Creed.</p>
            <p>True it is that he is Lord of al, but ſpecially of the church, For,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Being Lord of all, he is alſo of his Church, Pſal, 2.</p>
            <p n="2">2 He created vs all of nothing.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Hee hath deliuered vs all from the hands of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>

            <p>Ouer-ſhadowing implieth that this is a miſterie, and can not cleerely be ſeene into, ſo that the virgin her being as it were in a cloud, cannot tell how it is wrought. So as that we muſt not ſeeke curiouſly.</p>
            <p n="2">2 By opening the words of the Creede, which ſhewe what is done, <hi>conceiued,</hi> and by whom, <hi>of,</hi> or <hi>by the holie Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For vnderſtanding, that hee is ſaid to be conceiued, wee muſt know, 1 who is conceiued, 2 what it is to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, 3 wherefore it was neceſſary this conception ſhould be.</p>
            <p>The party conceiued, is, <hi>Ieſus Christ his onely Sonne our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 So that it appeareth, that hee that was conceiued, is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1866:92"/>God, that he might ad merit to the ſufferings, Act, 20, 28.</p>
            <p>Hence is he called Emanuel.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That he was the Sonne of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3 1 Becauſe it was meetes, as by the word all things were made, ſo to be renued: 2 the naturall ſonne of God might make adopted, 3 the beloued might bring into loue: 4 the image of God might renue to Gods image.</p>
            <p n="5">5 In the word life is ſaid, Ioh: 1, 4, to be: 6 God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might ſet out his wonderfull loue to man, in giuing his ſonne.</p>
            <p>Obiect: The ſecond perſon hath the whole diuine eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, therefore the whole diuine eſſence was incarnate.</p>
            <p>Aun. Hee was incarnate according to perſon, not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p>Now followeth what it is to be conceiued.</p>
            <p>Conceiued is of conception. Conception is a worke in the mother, whereby the young ſhee is with beginneth to be.</p>
            <p>This, if wee ſpeake properly, is for the firſt beginning, but heere it ſignifieth, beſides faſhioning and forming. So is it, Math: 1, 20. For the holy Ghoſt did frame him in the wombe, as well as worke his conception.</p>
            <p>Conceiued, then he is ſaide to be, when hee began to be man.</p>
            <p>In this conception we may conſider the
<list>
                  <item>parties.</item>
                  <item>properties.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt part is faſhioning and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the humane nature. This hath
<list>
                  <item>body.</item>
                  <item>ſoule.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The holy Ghoſt made the body of Chriſt, of the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſubſtance of the virgine, whereby it was free from ſinne.</p>
            <p>This body, 1 was true.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Had infirmities, which came not of ſinne.</p>
            <p>The ſoule was made of nothing in the wombe of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and perſon of the word.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part is aſſumption, vvhereby the Sonne
<pb facs="tcp:1866:93"/>vouchſafed to take to him the manhood, and not angely.</p>
            <p>The third is perſonall vnion.</p>
            <p>Vnion is whereby diuers things are gathered into one.</p>
            <p>Perſonall, when but one perſon, or being is made.</p>
            <p>For better vnderſtanding, know that vnion is, 1 of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in nature, as the Trinitie in the diuine Eſſence: 2 of natures in one perſon, as in Chriſt: 3 of perſons and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in will and affection, as diuers men.</p>
            <p>The middlemoſt is heere meant. Whereby the vvord taketh the humaine nature into vnity of perſon.</p>
            <p>From this vnion ariſeth a kinde of ſpeech, which they call communication of properties, when that which belongeth to one nature, is ſaid of the other, or of the whole perſon.</p>
            <p>The properties of this conception are in this, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Firſt at the ſame inſtant was ioyned to the vvord, a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſoule, and organicall body.</p>
            <p>The ſoule in other conceptions commeth after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p>It is moſt probable that Chriſtes body at the firſt in the body was organicall, and not <hi>Embrye,</hi> though it might in time increaſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 For the Word was being to mans fleſh. Mans fleſh is not where there is not a reaſonable ſoule, a reaſonable is not where there is not a formed body.</p>
            <p n="2">2 He was at the inſtant a perſon, therefore perfect.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It was not meete that the Author of all perfection ſhould be vnperfect.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the humaine nature did not ſubſiſt, or had no being out of the Word.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the vnion of theſe two after conception, is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in this vnion there is no confuſion or mixture of natures, properties, or actions.</p>
            <p>Now followeth, wherefore it was neceſſary that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception ſhould be.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That the fall of man might be repaired by man.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:1866:93"/> 2 That our Sauiour might die and fulfill the law.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That he might be our brother, Heb: 2, 11.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That he might be mercifull. Heb: 2, 17, 18.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That his pure conception, might excuſe our impure.</p>
            <p>Queſt: It may be demaunded, when hee was concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued?</p>
            <p>Aun. Immediatly vpon Maries ſpeech, <hi>Behold the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maide of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the 25 of March, one yeere ſooner then our Church of England: ſo as for 1601 ended, is 1602.</p>
            <p>One might meruaile why this day was not called, the feaſt of the conception of Chriſt, but annunciation of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
            <p>The day when this conception was, was (as ſome think) wedneſday.</p>
            <p>Now followeth by whom, <hi>Of the holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> the third perſon in Trinity.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>of,</hi> in Greeke <hi>E K,</hi> ſignifieth effectiuely or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially.</p>
            <p>Heere it ſignifieth effectiuely.</p>
            <p>Well ſaith Damaſcene, <hi>The holy Ghost begetteth, not ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically, but operatiuely:</hi> and Iuſtin Martyr, <hi>Not by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obiect: If Chriſt were conceiued of the holy Ghoſt, then is the holy Ghoſt his father.</p>
            <p>Aun. The Father giueth matter, ſo did not the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Chriſt according to his manhood had no Father, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his godhead had no mother.</p>
            <p>Thus farre the meaning.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Wee profeſſe heereby to diſavowe all fond opinions touching the incarnation of Chriſt, of Marcion, Apollina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, Neſtorius, Eutyches, Anabaptiſts.</p>
            <p n="2">2 We profeſſe that Chriſt is without ſinne.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That wee neede not be aſhamed of our conception, ſince Chriſt vouchſafed to be conceiued.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That women ſhould ſweeten their paines of concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb facs="tcp:1866:94"/>and bearing, in meditating of Chriſtes conception.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That Chriſtes pure conception, is to excuſe my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure.</p>
            <p n="6">6 That weakeneſſes naturall without ſinne, are no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, ſince Chriſt had them.</p>
            <p n="7">7 That wee ſhould come boldly to the throne of grace. Heb: 4, 15, 16. Looke Heb: 2, 14.</p>
            <p n="8">8 That as Chriſt tooke my nature, I ought to labour to partake the diuine nature in the qualities and holines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. 2, Pet: 1, 4.</p>
            <p>Thus farre the conception, the birth followeth, <hi>Borne of the virgin Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, conſider the grounds of this article.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Gen. 3, 15.</p>
            <p>Obiect. But it may be ſaid, there is mentioned a woman, this place ſpeaketh of a virgin.</p>
            <p>Aun. Woman is a name of ſexe, oppoſite to male, not to virgin.</p>
            <p>So in the law, woman compriſeth maide or virgin. <hi>It is</hi> (S. Auguſtine ſaith) <hi>the property of the Hebrew tongue, to vſe Woman for female.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Paul to the Gal. 4, 4. ſo vſeth the word woman, <hi>Made of a Woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 A ſecond place is, Eſa, 7. <hi>Avirgin ſhall conceiue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Iewes take exception, &amp; ſay, it is meant of a young woman.</p>
            <p>The Hebrew is <hi>Gnalma,</hi> that ſignifieth one kept ſecret, and vntouched of man.</p>
            <p>It is obſerued that it is but thrice in ſcriptures ioyned with <hi>He</hi> notificatiue, as Gen. 24. Exod. 2, and Eſa, 7, 14. Now as in the former, it ſignifieth a virgine, why ſhould it not heere?</p>
            <p>Well haue the tranſlators ſaid, <hi>the virgin,</hi> as of one ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Therefore the 72 Interpreters haue tranſlated it <hi>a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, God heere ſhewing a ſtrange ſigne, would neuer tell of a young woman to haue a child, that were no newes.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1866:94"/>
            <p> Beſides, Luk, 1, 27, is manifeſt, and Math: 1, 23.</p>
            <p>Wierus reporteth a ſtrange ſtory out of Sudas, if it be true.</p>
            <p>The Fathers would ſhew it by likelyhoods from other things, as of Aarons rod budding, Adams being formed of earth.</p>
            <p>Adrichomius telleth a ſtrange thing, if it be true, of flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers at the fountaine of Eliſaeus, hee ſaith, they are called Hiericho roſes, which ſhoote out on the day of the natiuity of Chriſt, and ſhut againe, in token of the birth of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. One may beleeue this that will.</p>
            <p>The meaning will appeare by the words, where we may conſider the thing mentioned, and the perſon.</p>
            <p>The thing is, <hi>borne,</hi> perſon, <hi>virgin Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Borne,</hi> ſheweth that after conception and perfection in due time, he was brought out into the world.</p>
            <p>For the better knowing whereof, confider, where, when, how Chriſt was borne.</p>
            <p>He was borne at Bethlehem, a ſmall village, laid in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>When, In the fulneſſe of time, Gal: 4, 4, According to the propheſies of Daniel.</p>
            <p>From the creation of the world the 3967.</p>
            <p>Of Auguſtus raigne. 45.</p>
            <p>After her conception nyne moneths, as Vſuardus and Adrichomius think: or as S. Auguſt: nyne moneths and ſixe dayes.</p>
            <p>Some ſay he was borne on a Friday, when the firſt man was borne: And that at midnight. Theſe are vncerteine.</p>
            <p>The manner how, as other children the Virgins wornbe opening.</p>
            <p>For he tooke vpon him all our weakeneſſes.</p>
            <p>The virgin was purified.</p>
            <p>Chriſt was preſented, as firſt opening the wombe. Luk: 2, 22.</p>
            <p>Tertullian ſaith, <hi>who openeth the wombe, as he who openeth it when it was ſhut.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:95"/>
            <p> Origen, <hi>The mothers wombe was opened when ſhe was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The perſon followeth by note, and firſt, that ſhe is a <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Virgin,</hi> is of virginitie.</p>
            <p>Virginitie is vntainted chaſtitie in ſingle life, ſuch had Mary.</p>
            <p>She was a virgin before her deliuery, in her deliuery, and after.</p>
            <p>Obiect: But one may ſay <hi>vntill</hi> is vſed, Math. 1, 25, as if afterward Ioſeph knew her.</p>
            <p>Aun. Vntill, doth not exclude for afterward, as when Chriſt ſaith: <hi>I am with you to the end of the world.</hi> And Paul, <hi>He ſhall raigne till he hath put downe all enemies.</hi> There is no deniall in either place for afterward.</p>
            <p>Obiect: Againe, it may be obiected, that Chriſt hath brothers, as Math: 12, 47.</p>
            <p>Aun. Some thinke they were Ioſephs children by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wife, I iudge rather that they were Chriſtes kindred, by the mothers ſide.</p>
            <p>Though Mary was, and continued a virgin, yet ſhe was no vowed virgin.</p>
            <p>Shee was ſo a virgin as affianced, why was that will ſome body ſay?</p>
            <p>Aun. I thinke, with purpoſe to haue maried, till God diſpoſed otherwiſe, then God turned it to ſpeciall vſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That Ioſeph being of the line of Dauid, of which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was, it might appeare by his genealogie, that Chriſt came of the line of Dauid.</p>
            <p>For trybes did not marry out of their trybes, ſaue the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticall onely.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That Mary might be kept from danger of the Law.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That ſhe might haue an helpe and ſuccour.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Some thinke it was (but vnwarrantably) to beguile the deuill, that he ſhould not know that Chriſt was borne of a virgin.</p>
            <p n="5">5 To try the Iewes faith, whether they would beleeue
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1866:95"/>aright, ſeeing there was thoughts, as though Ioſeph had beene his father.</p>
            <p>Her proper name is <hi>Mary,</hi> the ſame that <hi>Miriam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The things we profeſſe heereby are,</p>
            <p n="1">1 That wee diſavow any teaching that denieth the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity of Mary.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That I am willing to beare any ſlaunders of the Iewes in this behalfe.</p>

            <p n="4">4 That the promiſe made touching the ſeede of Dauid, is performed.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That as Chriſt was borne of the virgin, ſo he ſhould be faſhioned in me.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The witneſſes of ſcripture for this whole are, Act: 4, 27. 1, Tim: 6, 13.</p>
            <p>In parts are, and firſt for ſuffering.</p>
            <p>This was fore-told. 1, Pet. 1, 11.</p>
            <p>Prophecied, Eſa, 53, the whole chapter.</p>
            <p>Fulfilled, as may appeare in the ſtory of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Was meete it ſhould be ſo, Math: 16, 21, Mar. 8, 31. Mar:
<pb facs="tcp:1866:96"/>9, 12, Luk, 24, 26.</p>
            <p>So ſaith Peter, 3, 18, Act: 17, 3.</p>
            <p>Yea, it is very behoouefull, ſo Heb. 2, 18.</p>
            <p>So as indeede all ſhould take knowledge of, Act. 26, 23.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>Vnder Pontius Pylat,</hi> reade Pſal: 2.</p>
            <p>The people of the Iewes requeſted it might be ſo.</p>
            <p>We may ſee it applied and fulfilled.</p>
            <p>Yea, prophane ſtories are not mute in this.</p>
            <p>The meaning will appeare, by knowing the branches, the firſt the thing, <hi>ſuffered,</hi> the other, the time, <hi>vnder Pontius Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the better vnderſtanding of <hi>ſuffered,</hi> 4 points are to be opened.</p>
            <p>The firſt, who ſuffered, that is, the ſonne of God, not the Father, not Simon of Cyrene, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Queſt. How could the Sonne ſuffer being God?</p>
            <p>Aun. According to his manhood, that onely ſuffereth.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, what it is to ſuffer. To ſuffer in this place, is to haue feeling, and that not of things pleaſing to nature, but diſpleaſing. So is Chriſt ſaide to ſuffer, and to be as a man of ſorrowes.</p>
            <p>The things he ſuffered, are many, Math. 16, 21. Mar. 8, 31.</p>
            <p>And theſe are ſuch as from his conception till his riſing, though ſuch eſpecially meant, as were in Pilats times.</p>
            <p>Theſe are as wearineſſe, hunger, thirſt: but eſpecially ſhame, greefe, feare, tentations.</p>
            <p>Queſt. Did Chriſt doe nothing?</p>
            <p>Aun. Yes, he performed the whole law of God, and that to teach vs, that it ought to be performed.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To adde his merit.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That it might be imputed vnto vs.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That we might haue a perfect patterne to follow.</p>
            <p>Queſt. Why are not his doings mentioned heere.</p>

            <p>Aunſwer. Yes: but then was the greateſt, euen death it ſelfe.</p>

            <p n="1">1 This was prefigured, Num, 21, 8, expounded to that end by Chriſt. Ioh. 3, 14.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This was prefigured by the laying of the ſacrifices vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the wood.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Preſignified by Chriſt, Ioh: 12, 32, 33.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And is ſaid to be needfull, Ioh. 3, 14, 15.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Fore-told immediatly before it ſhould be, Math: 26, 2.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Deſired of the people, Math. 27, 22, 23.</p>
            <p n="7">7 So ordered by Pylat, Math, 27, 26.</p>
            <p n="8">8 He was led by the people to that end, Math. 27, 31.</p>
            <p n="9">9 He was crucified, Math: 27, 35. as Peter telleth them. Act. 2, 23.</p>
            <p n="10">10 He was ſought for after he was crucified. Math. 28, 5.</p>
            <p n="11">11 The Apoſtles ſo preached, 1, Cor: 1, 23.</p>
            <p n="12">12 See Paules eſtimation heereof, 1, Cor. 2, 2. Gal. 6, 14.</p>
            <p n="13">13 The Iewes to this day call Chriſt, <hi>Talvi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The meaning will appeare by the word and ſignification.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Crucified,</hi> that is faſtened to the croſſe.</p>
            <p>The croſſe was a kind of puniſhment which the Iewes learned of the Romanes, for to execute traitours againſt the Prince.</p>
            <p>The Iewiſh common puniſhmentes were beheadding, ſtrangling, ſtoning, burning.</p>
            <p>This the Iewes deſired that Chriſt might ſuffer, to flatter with Pilate and the Romanes, &amp; to beare the world in hand they counted him a troubler of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>The forme of this croſſe was like a great Romane T, ſaue in the middeſt was a litle foote place, wherto the feete ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding were nayled.</p>
            <p>Faſtened, betokeneth that his handes were tied or nayled, and ſo his feete, there to continue till he died, as ſuch as are hanged aliue in chaines. For that was their order.</p>
            <p>The ſignification implieth that Chriſt ſuffered this puniſhment with the appurtenances. Wherof looke Deut. 21, 23 Gal: 3.13.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:1866:97"/>
            <p> A partie thus hanged was accurſed.</p>
            <p>Queſt. What is meant by accurſed.</p>
            <p>Aun. By accurſed is properly meant, that a partie is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the anger and wrath of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That all thinges proceeding from this wrath of God, may fall vpon ſuch a partie. Looke Deut. 28. Leuit. 26.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That theſe may fall preſently, and continue perpetually.</p>
            <p>Queſt. How was Chriſt made a curſe? An: God the Father imputing it to him: himſelfe taking it vpon him.</p>
            <p>Queſt. If Chriſt were accurſed, why did he not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue?</p>
            <p>Aun. His merites were ſuch as the curſe could find no continuance vpon him.</p>
            <p>Beſides, his godhead ouercame it. As a paile full of water may quench a litle fire, but a great fire wil get the maſtery of it. And the thinges which would haue held other men, Sampſon ouercame: ſo the curſe that would haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com vs. Chriſt ouercame.</p>
            <p>This crucifying or being crucified, was ſo accurſed as that,</p>
            <p n="1">1 It procured taking away ſinnes &amp; reconciliation. Looke Heb. 9.28: looke Eph: 2.16. Col: 1.20.</p>
            <p n="2">2 By it Chriſt triumphed ouer all ſpirituall enemies. Col: 2.15.</p>
            <p>The things we doe profeſſe are,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Diſavowing of all corrupt doctrine touching the croſſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 As that the croſſe where-vpon Chriſt hung, is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored for the touching of his body.</p>
            <p>For firſt it is fabulous which is reported, touching the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the croſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſuch adoration is forbidden in the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Ezechiah brake the braſen ſerpent, when it was applied to like abuſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, why might not Iudas lips and the tormentors whips, &amp;c, alike be adored.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:98"/>
            <p> Fiftly, one might as well reuerence the gallowes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his friend were executed.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, ſuch like things doe the Turkes, religiouſly vſing a peece of the Arke of Noah.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That the likenes of the Croſſe is to be worſhipped. For if not the Croſſe, much leſſe the likenes.</p>
            <p>Obiect. Math. 24, 30. Mention is made of the ſigne of the Sonne of man, to wit, the Croſſe.</p>
            <p>An. It is meant of Chriſt himſelfe, as Act. 1, 11. Reu. 1, 7.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The ſigne of the Croſſe is venerable. Much more then, the Croſſe: but the contrary was ſhewed before. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if the ſigne ſhould be holy, it ſhould be for like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to the true Croſſe, but that hath it none. The likenes of the true Croſſe is T. the ſigne is <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>. or <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>. or ſuch like.</p>
            <p>Obiect: But ſome Churches vſe the ſigne of the Croſſe.</p>
            <p>Aun. As an outward or ciuill thing, for order, not for holines. For neither a baptiſed party hauing the Croſſe, is thought to haue more holines, neither one wanting it, is thought for that to haue the leſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Learne what is the true crucifix. Chriſt preached, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. Gal: 3, 1.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That wee by nature are accurſed, for whom Chriſt muſt be crucified.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That by Chriſtes being crucified, wee are freed from the curſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That we are deliuered, from captiuity to hell, ſinne, and ſathan, Chriſt hauing triumphed ouer them all.</p>
            <p n="6">6 That with Chriſt wee muſt be willing to beare our Croſſe. Math. 16, 16.</p>
            <p n="7">7 That wee muſt loue Chriſt crucified. 1, Cor. 2, 2. Gal. 6, 14.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Not to be aſhamed of the ſcandall of the Croſſe.</p>
            <p n="9">9 To be crucified with Chriſt, Gal. 2, 1, Gal. 6, 14.</p>
            <p n="10">10 To aduaunce the Croſſe of Chriſt, 1, Cor. 1, 17.</p>

               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:1866:98"/> 12 This article ſhould keepe vs from relying on men to much. 1, Cor. 1, 13.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Prefigured in all the bloody ſacrifices, as is ſhewed, Heb. 9, 12.1, Cor. 5, 7, Ioh. 19, 36, 1, Pet. 1, 19.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Fore-told by Eſay, 53, 7. Dan. 9, 26.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Chriſt himſelfe darkly fore-telleth it, Ioh. 12, 24, 33, and Ioh: 18, 32, and Mar. 10, 33, 34.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Euen Caiphas againſt his will prophecied. Ioh. 11, 49.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The Iewes went about it, Ioh: 7, 19, 25:</p>
            <p n="7">7 They ſought for falſe witnes to this purpoſe. Mar: 14, 55.</p>
            <p n="8">8 They put Chriſt to death, as Peter telleth them, Act: 3, 15.</p>
            <p n="9">9 He was dead. Ioh: 19, 33.</p>
            <p n="10">10 So the Apoſtles declare, 1, Cor: 15, 3.</p>
            <p n="11">11 And Chriſt himſelfe as paſt, Reuel. 2, 8.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Paul ſheweth the end, Rom. 4, 25. And more, Heb. 2, 14.</p>
            <p n="13">13 The perſons for whom are not left out. 2, Cor: 5, 14. Yet ſo as Paul reſtraineth them, Rom: 5, 6, 8. 1. Theſſ. 5, 10.</p>
            <p>The meaning heereof will appeare, if we know,</p>
            <p>Firſt, what it is to die.</p>
            <p>To die properly in a reaſonable creature, is to haue the ſoule ſeuered from the body. So was it with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Obiect: Did not this vntie the perſonall vnion?</p>
            <p>Aun. No: For though the body and ſoule were ſeuered from betweene themſelues, both were ioyned to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, ſo as the body was preſerued from corruption, the ſoule was in happines.</p>
            <p>Queſt. How could the Prince of life die? Aun. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his body, and in his body.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if we know &amp; conſider the ſort of Chriſts death.</p>
            <p>Death may be ſaid to be
<list>
                  <item>naturall.</item>
                  <item>violent.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:99"/>
            <p> Naturall the cauſe wherof breedeth in ones ſelfe, this we call ones faire death.</p>
            <p>Violent is when the cauſe is without one, as by ſword, fire, ſtrangling &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Chriſtes death was violent, foretold by Eſay 53.7, by Chriſt, Math. 16.21, and Math: 17.23. and Math: 21.38: ſo endeuoured the Iewes, Ioh. 7, 25, ſo did they. 1, Theſſ. 2, 15.</p>
            <p>Queſt. But why violent? Aun. Chriſt had nothing in himſelfe to cauſe him to die. 2 It was meete that ſo things prefigured in ſacrifices might be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>Yet ſo for all that was it violent, as voluntary, Ioh: 10, 18. Therefore is it, that Chriſt crying aloud, gaue vp the Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if wee know, whether Chriſt died as wee were dead, or ſhould die.</p>
            <p>Death is

            <p>Worldly, is the ſeuering of ſoule from body.</p>
            <p>Spirituall, is the ſeuering of ſoule and body from ſauing grace.</p>
            <p>Euerlaſting, is the ſeuering of ſoule and body from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting glory.</p>
            <p>Chriſt (I take it) died onely the firſt death, and ouercame the two other: Procuring by his death, that worldly death becommeth no croſſe to vs.</p>
            <p>Deliuering vs, from ſpirituall death.</p>
            <p>Cauſing that euerlaſting death ſhall neuer approach to vs.</p>
            <p>How ſhould the fountaine of grace and glory be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of either?</p>
            <p>The things which the ſcripture teacheth to profeſſe, are,</p>
            <p n="1">1 That if one died, then were all dead. 2, Cor. 5, 14.</p>
            <p>That is, 1 that euery one muſt naturally die. Heb. 9, 27.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1866:99"/>
            <p> Obiect. Henoch, and Elias died not.</p>
            <p>An. A priuiledge taketh not away a law. Their tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was a kind of death.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Euery of vs were dead ſpiritually, Eph, 2, 1, Colo, 2, 13, not the virgine Mary excepted.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That all had deſerued euerlaſting death, Ephe, 2, 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To take heede of ſinne, ſithence the ſtipend thereof is death, inſomuch as Chriſt putting our perſon vppon him, could not eſcape death, Rom, 6, 23.</p>
            <p n="3">3 To be perſwaded of the loue of God to vs, Rom, 5, 8.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That all, and euery of our ſinnes are ſatisfied for, Rom, 4, 25, Heb, 9, 12, Gala, 2, 21. Inſomuch as no puniſhment ſhall be inflicted, Rom, 8, 33, 34.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That I am freed from obedience to the law in the rigor thereof, Rom, 6, 7. Inſomuch as mens traditions ſhall not bind me, Colo, 2, 20, 21.</p>
            <p n="6">6 That euen the curſe of death is taken away, hence are places of buriall called ſleeping places, and death ſleepe.</p>
            <p>Ob: All die. An: The ſting of death is ſinne, 1, Corin, 15, 56, which beeing taken out, it ſhall not hurt vs: ſo to the godly is death the entrance to happineſſe.</p>
            <p n="7">7 That I ſhould die to ſinne, Rom, 6, 3, Colo, 3, 3, 5.</p>
            <p n="8">8 We muſt take heed of ſcandaliſing our brethren, Rom, 14, 15, 1, Cor, 8, 11. A ſcandall is occaſion of ſin.</p>
            <p>Nay wee muſt doe all the good wee can to our brethren. Iohn, 1, 3, 16.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The more our outward man perriſheth, the more ſhould our inner man be renued, 2, Cor, 4, 10, 16.</p>
            <p n="10">10 To be perſwaded, that if we die, wee die to the Lord. Rom, 14, 8. That is, ſhould die in the Lord, that is, pleaſing him by faith in Chriſt, and in good conſcience.</p>

            <p n="2">2 A type therof was in Ionas, Math, 12, 39, 40. 3 It was preſignified by the woman. Mar, 14, 3, Math, 26, 12.</p>

            <p>The meaning is euident, that Chriſtes body was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed apart from humane ſocietie, as other dead bodies were wont to be ſerued.</p>
            <p>And this was not onely, 1 To witneſſe that he was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead, but that the victory might be the greater in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 2 That he might be abaſed to the loweſt. 3 And to fulfill the type in Ionas.</p>
            <p>The things the ſcripture teacheth vnder this article which we profeſſe are,</p>
            <p n="1">1 A ſure confirmation of Chriſtes death, in that hee was buried.</p>

            <p n="3">3 To teach vs that wee ſhould not much reſpect buriall in our ſelues, or neglect it for our friends in comly ſort.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt particular for abaſement is <hi>Deſcended into hell,</hi> whereof before I ſpeake as of the other, I thinke good to admoniſh to preuent miſinterpreting, and miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:1866:100"/> 1 Whereas all learned men are not of one mind touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meaning of this article, I profeſſe that my ſelfe doe hold, &amp; wiſh my hearers to hold in this point, as the church of England holdeth and belieueth, and that I, if I ſeeme to any in ſpeaking of this article to erre, will ſubmit my ſelfe to the iudgement of them, who can and ought to iudge, &amp; that very willingly vppon reaſon out of the ſcriptures vvill change my mind, and mind not to caſt a ſnare vppon any, but wiſh them to try that which I ſpeake.</p>
            <p n="2">2 I thinke that the not knowing of the true and proper meaning of this article, ſhall not hinder ones ſaluation, who belieueth the whole ſcriptures, and the doctrine thereof, &amp; denieth not the words of this article, but willingly ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe to be inſtructed in the truth.</p>
            <p>They therefore who agree in other matters of faith neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to ſaluation, &amp; differing in this breake charitie, are too blame.</p>
            <p>As likewiſe ſuch as charge men to deny their Creede, if they hold not the ſame meaning of this article with them, though they hold the words.</p>
            <p n="3">3 I iudge that our Church of England, hath not ſynodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chally by publique authoritie ſet downe, what ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be the proper meaning of this article.</p>
            <p>Priuate men haue their priuate opinions, good they may be, but not to bind the whole church.</p>
            <p>The reaſons to induce me thus to thinke, are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Our booke of articles agreed vpon 1562, ſetteth down onely the words of the article, &amp; of purpoſe (as it ſeemeth) leaueth out ſomewhat, that was in that article in King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> time.</p>
            <p n="2">2 A very learned, and reuerend Biſhop of this land, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that he was <hi>forced to promiſe, that he would openly deliuer, which he thought was the likeliest and ſafest ſence, as well of this article. &amp;c.</hi> Which he would neuer haue written, if he had thought our whole Church had agreed in one meaning. Neither indeed, the matter beeing ouer-ruled by the word,
<pb facs="tcp:1866:101"/>ought he.</p>
            <p>There is a ſaying when a law is made, he who will be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer then the law, is a foole.</p>
            <p>The ſame learned man ſayeth, that he <hi>hath not ſo full and faire warrant</hi> (for the meaning of this article) <hi>as he had for the redemption of man by the blood of Christ.</hi> And yet what warrant he hath for this, learned men may examine. Beſides he addeth, that <hi>he was aduiſed, and requested by men of greater place then he will name, to put the effect of that which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered in writing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>the learned might iudge of the doctrine.</hi> Whereby it appeareth that this learned Biſhop, and the other of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter place then he will name, meant that learned men ſhould iudge, whether he hath throughly written of theſe matters, and trying, they might keepe that which is good.</p>
            <p>Obiect: There is a Catechiſme ſet out by publique au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority expounding this article.</p>
            <p>Aun. I know not whether the Catechiſme be tolerated to be taught young children, or enioyned to all, as the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of our Church. Beſides I allow of the meaning in that Catechiſme, as Doctor Whitaker hath done it into Greeke.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Though Ruffinus write, that this article is not in the Creede of the Romaine Church, nor is in the Churches of the Eaſt, and though Auguſtine, Tom. 9, in his expoſition vpon the Creede to the Catechized, leaue it out, and it be not in the Nicene Creede, and Eraſmus write, that he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it was put into the Creede about the time of Thomas Aquinas: yet I hold it is not to be left out, for that other auncient Fathers haue mention of it, as I take it, Ignatius, Epiphanius, Athanaſius, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Many things by ſome being written about this article, I meane only for edifying of the ſimple, to ſpeake as plainly as I can of it, and not to goe out into by diſcourſes.</p>
            <p n="6">6 I thinke it not good to note any mans perſon, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by an ordinarie courſe of preaching brought to ſpeake heereof, to be faithfull as God hath giuen to ſhew the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1866:101"/>heereof, and to prepare for what can come againſt.</p>
            <p>The meaning is not all a-like to all men.</p>
            <p>Opinions touching the meaning of it, are
<list>
                  <item>manifeſtly falſe.</item>
                  <item>probably true.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Manifeſtly falſe are two, the firſt of ſuch who thinke that Chriſtes humaine ſoule after the ſeparation from the body, went downe to the hell of the damned, to ſuffer the paines of hell. Againſt theſe diſputeth <hi>Hillarius 16. de Trinitate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond is of the Papiſts, who thinke that he went downe to <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> (the vpper Region, or ſuburbs of hell) to take vp to heauen the ſoules of the godly, which they imagined to reſt there till Chriſtes reſurrection.</p>
            <p>Both theſe are ſo groſſe, that they need not to be confuted.</p>
            <p>Probably true, are ſuch as haue ſome probability of truth, ſome more, ſome leſſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt opinion is, <hi>that Christ in his humaine ſoule after the parting of it from the body, went to hell, properly ſo called of the damned, and there did tryumph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others there are which ſeeme to me to haue more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of truth:</p>
            <p>Of theſe ſome be only true, others true, fit, and proper.</p>
            <p>Only true, as that which interpreteth this article, by <hi>buried.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As alſo that which holdeth that Chriſtes ſufferings on the Croſſe, &amp; in his agonie are ſignified heere.</p>
            <p>True, and fit, and proper, as I take it (yet to be examined by the word of God, and doctrine taught in the Church of England) is that opinion which holdeth the meaning to be that Chriſt was among the dead in greateſt abaſement.</p>
            <p>Chriſtes being among the dead, cannot by any that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>Eis adou</hi> be denied.</p>
            <p>This abaſement is ſignified, Eſa, 53, when it is ſaid, <hi>he was oppreſſed,</hi> and in Dan. 9, 26. In ſo much as victory is aſcribed to <hi>Ades.</hi> 1. Cor. 15, 55.</p>
            <p>We take not to tell what Chriſt did, which the Scripture maketh not mention of.</p>
            <p>This opinion hath diſtinction of matter from the former
<pb facs="tcp:1866:102"/>articles, as being a degree lower, hath order as being in time after, hath proprietie of words, as no learned man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</p>
            <p>The things the word of God teacheth vs to profeſſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence are,</p>
            <p n="1">1 The wretchednes of ſinne to make reconciliation, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt was ſo abaſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The loue of God the Father, and Chriſt to vs, that for our ſakes he was humbled ſo low.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Not to deſpaire how low ſo euer we be brought, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering our Sauiour Chriſt in this article.</p>
            <p>Hitherto Chriſtes former eſtate.</p>
            <p>Hitherto Chriſtes abaſement, his aduauncement follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, which is noted, Luk, 24, 46, that ſo it ought to be.</p>
            <p>This is whereby Chriſt is lifted aboue all creatures.</p>
            <p>Queſt. Can the Godhead receaue glory? Aun. No: not of addition, but of manifeſtation.</p>
            <p>His humaine nature was freed from all weakeneſſes.</p>
            <p>His ſoule from ignorance, and griefe.</p>
            <p>His body was immortall, nimble, and glorious, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This aduauncement is in foure degrees. The firſt is, <hi>the third day he aroſe from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Scriptures for the which are,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Propheſie, Pſal. 16, 10.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Type in Ionas, Math. 12, 40.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Fore-telling by Chriſt darkly, Iohn, 2, 19, 20, 21, 22, and Math: 17, 9.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Chriſt manifeſtly ſpeaketh of it, Mark, 8, 31, 32.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The euent doth confirme in all the Euangeliſts.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Yea, an Angell witneſſeth it, Mark, 16, 6.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Chriſt himſelfe ſheweth it was requiſite. Luk, 24, 46.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Peter treateth at large of it, Act, 2.</p>
            <p n="9">9 So doth Paul, 1, Cor. 15, 14, 17.</p>
            <p n="10">10 In ſo much as Mathias was choſen a witnes thereof. Acts, 1, 22.</p>
            <p n="11">11 To this gaue the Apoſtles witnes. Acts, 4, 33.</p>
            <p n="12">12 The Iewes themſelues could not denie it. Math. 28,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1866:102"/>11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Iuſtin Martyr chargeth Tryphon with the ſame.</p>
            <p>And this article is the more to be held, for that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans may beleeue Chriſt to be dead, onely Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue he roſe.</p>
            <p>Obiect: Thomas doubted.</p>
            <p>Aun. That was that we ſhould not doubt, as well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth Leo.</p>
            <p>The meaning followeth.</p>
            <p>But firſt the words of the Creed, and Math. 12.40, muſt be reconciled.</p>
            <p>In Mathew the words are vſed by Synecdoche as Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine obſerueth. And three implyeth, not three full, but three beginning.</p>
            <p>Sure it is that Chriſt was not three nights in the graue.</p>
            <p>There is therefore a Synecdoche.</p>
            <p>In the words of the Creede, is the time, the thing.</p>
            <p>Time, <hi>the third day.</hi> Thing, <hi>aroſe from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Day, to ſpeake properly, is 24 houres ſpace: heere it is taken for part thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third day</hi> is from the buriall.</p>
            <p>He was buried on that we call Friday, before the Sunne ſetting, and roſe on Sonday morning, at, or before the Sunne riſing.</p>
            <p>The Iewes counted their day from euening to euening, ſo as the light on the day we call Friday, was part of their former day, ſo as Chriſt was one whole day in the graue, &amp; part of two.</p>
            <p>The day Chriſt roſe on, was the firſt day of creation of the world, now called, Reuel. 1, 10. the Lords day, not to be changed from religious vſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roſe,</hi> that is, his body roſe, the Godhead could not, the ſoule did not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From the dead,</hi> that is, out of the graue.</p>
            <p>So as that the body aroſe, that is, was quickned by the Godhead, and that to fulfill the propheſies touching this, as alſo to verifie the euerlaſtingnes of his kingdome, and to
<pb facs="tcp:1866:103"/>ſhew himſelfe a victorious tryumpher.</p>
            <p>In this article the Scripture teacheth,</p>
            <p n="1">1 That Chriſt is God, Rom, 1, 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That we are iuſtified from our ſinnes, Rom, 4, 25, Cor, 1, 15, 17, Rom, 8, 34, Cor, 1, 15, 55.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That we muſt riſe from ſin to newneſſe of life, Rom, 6, 4, Phil, 3, 10.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That we ſhould ſet our affections on things aloft, Colo: 3, 1.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Our head beeing riſen, that we ſhould riſe. Chriſt is the firſt fruits.</p>
            <p>The ſecond degree is, <hi>He aſcended into heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 For this are ſcriptures, Pſalm, 68, 18.</p>
            <p n="2">2 A forerunning example in Elias, 2, Kings, 2, 11.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Signified by Chriſt aloofe of, Iohn, 6, 62, more plainly, Iohn, 14, 19, and Iohn, 16, 16.</p>
            <p n="4">4 In ſo much as Iohn, 16, 7, Chriſt witneſſeth it to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expedient, for that hee goeth before to prepare a place. Iohn, 14, 2.</p>
            <p n="5">5 This as the time drew neerer, Chriſt himſelfe ſpake more plainly of, as Iohn, 20, 17.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The fulfilling thereof wee may reade, Mark, 16, 19, Luk, 24, 51.</p>
            <p n="7">7 So as the manner is not left out, Acts 1, 9.</p>
            <p n="8">8 The ſame doth Peter preach, Act, 2.33, 34. And Paul writing ſtand vpon it, Eph. 4, 9, 10. Noting it as a chiefe part of the miſterie of godlines. 1, Tim. 3, 16.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Some take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to note the very particuler place, as hauing ſome marke at this time, ſo euident is it.</p>
            <p>The meaning may appeare out of the words, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie a mouing to a place.</p>
            <p>The mouing in the word <hi>aſcended:</hi> the place <hi>heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For better knowing of <hi>aſcended,</hi> marke the ſignification of the word, what aſcended, by what meanes, and to what end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſcended,</hi> ſignifieth lifted, or mounted vp on high. So as whereas Chriſt bodily before on the earth, he doth no more
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1866:103"/>ſo now.</p>
            <p>Therefore is it ſaid he was carried vp, Luke 24, 51, as Acts 1, 9, and therefore is, Tim, 1, 3, 16, glory added.</p>
            <p>The Godhead did not, nor could aſcend beeing euery where.</p>
            <p>The manhood onely aſcended, wherby is implied an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence thereof.</p>
            <p>Ob: Chriſt ſaith, I am with you to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>An. To all creatures by his diuine eſſence, power, and prouidence, to his children by myſticall headſhip, &amp; gifts of the holy Ghoſt, not bodily.</p>
            <p>The Godhead caried vp the manhood.</p>
            <p>He aſcended, 1 To ſhew Angels and powers ſubiect to him, 1, Pet, 3, 22.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To giue gifts to his Church, Ephe, 4, 16, Iohn, 16, 7.</p>

            <p>The third degree is, <hi>and ſitteth at the right hand of God the father Almighty.</hi> For which are ſcriptures.</p>

            <p>So as I take it, ſitting is put for beeing preſent, &amp; there abiding.</p>
            <p>Now this is not alone: for firſt it is with continuaunce, Acts, 3, 22, Heb, 10, 12, ſo as well is it in the article <hi>ſitting,</hi> not that he is tyed, or violently held there, but that he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth there in manhood to continue.</p>
            <p>Ob: Hee appeared to Saule by the way, or in the way, Acts, 9, 5.</p>
            <p>An: It doth not hinder, but that hee was in heauen ſtill, for Stephen ſaw him there. Acts, 7, 55.</p>
            <p>Secondly with dooing ſomewhat. For he is not in heauen idle: but 1 maketh interceſſion, Rom, 8, 34, Heb, 10, 12.</p>
            <p>Interceſſion, is making intreatie in his Churches behalfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not by proſtrating his body: but</p>
            <p n="1">1 For that he appeareth in heauen with mans nature, &amp; his owne deſerts, for the Church. Heb, 9, 24.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The blood of his ſprinkling abiding for euer efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Heb, 12, 24.</p>
            <p n="3">3 For that Chriſt willeth that his ſatisfaction ſhould be imputed to all whom the Father hath giuen vnto him.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And Chriſt cauſeth that his apply Chriſtes merits to themſelues.</p>
            <p>Now Chriſt ſo maketh interceſſion, as alone.</p>
            <p>Ob: The Spirit is ſaid to make requeſts, Rom, 8, 26.</p>
            <p>An: Interceſſion noted in Chriſt, is by ſatisfaction in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature. So doth not the Spirit: that onely ſtirreth vs vp to pray vnto God. And that is Paules meaning, Rom, 8, 26.</p>
            <p>Que. Maketh Chriſt interceſſion in one or both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>
            <p>An. In his whole perſon.</p>
            <p>Ob: Then Chriſt beeing God, ſhould make interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, that is to himſelfe.</p>

            <p>The place is at <hi>the right hand of God the Father almightie.</hi> What GOD the Father almighty meaneth and teacheth, looke before. <hi>Right hand</hi> is vſed in compariſon.</p>
            <p>Right and left hand are taken from bodily things: ſo as a ſpirit hath not properly right hand or left.</p>
            <p>Right hand, arme, eyes, are ſaid to be in GOD, but not properly. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstand not right hand in God properly</hi> (ſaith S. Baſil) <hi>least thou thinke there be in him a left alſo.</hi> Skaion.</p>
            <p>Such parts are ſaid to be in God, when thereby is noted to be in God the dooing of the things, whereto thoſe parts in men ſerue, as arme for ſtrength, eye for knowledge.</p>
            <p>Right hand among men is vſed diuerſly.</p>
            <p>Cyrus ſet thoſe whom he loued beſt at his left hand next his heart.</p>
            <p>Among the Numidians the middle place was honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>In Scripture and with vs, the right and being at it noteth honour, as of Salomon toward Bathſheba. 1. King, 2, 19.</p>
            <p>The ſonnes of Zebede ſo deſired, ſo is it Pſal, 45, 9.</p>
            <p>So as this in Chriſt doth ſignifie partaking manifeſted glory, looke. Act, 7, 55.</p>
            <p>For as a Prince vnder the chaire of eſtate, placing one at his right hand, noteth the great glory wherein he would haue the partie appeare, ſo is it heere.</p>
            <p>Indeede the Godhead was alwayes glorious, but it hid it ſelfe for a while: heere then is the bewraying of it.</p>
            <p>This muſt then be remembred to be after his aſcenſion, and not to the deſtroying of the humane nature.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>God the Father almightie</hi> is named (I take it) to note the kind of glory, as not worldly, but heauenly, as is of him who is <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>almightie,</hi> and not to be looked for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, as of or in bodily things of this lower world.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:1866:105"/>
            <p> The words ioyntly may eaſily be vnderſtood, as meaning that he who before was ſo baſe, as to deſcend into hell, is now in the greateſt glory in heauen.</p>
            <p>Que. According to which nature ſitteth Chriſt at Gods right hand.</p>
            <p>Aun. According to both, &amp; therefore is it ſaid of Chriſt the perſon. For although the Godhead were alwayes in infinite glory, yet did it for a time after the incarnation (as it were) hide it ſelfe, but not for euer, but after the riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine from dead, did make it ſelfe knowne to be in glory, euen in the humane nature.</p>
            <p>According to the diuine nature he ſitteth at Gods right hand, as manifeſting the humaine: and lightening the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine nature, as it were, with beames of the Godhead.</p>
            <p>According to the humaine, in as much as the humaine nature by habituall gifts, as wiſedome, power, maieſtie is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all creatures, ſo as Chriſt euen in the humaine nature, is Lord of all creatures, and is therein to be adored.</p>
            <p>Queſt. Doth not this ſitting at the right hand imply ſome inferiority?</p>
            <p>Aun. Chriſt in reſpect of his office of mediatour, and of the humaine nature, is inferiour to the Father, according to the diuine Eſſence he is equall.</p>
            <p>Some from this article, as much as in them lieth, would ouerthrow the humaine nature of Chriſt, at leaſt hold that which ouerthroweth it.</p>
            <p>For thus they reaſon. The right hand of God is euery where, Chriſt is at the right hand of God, therefore Chriſt is euery where.</p>
            <p>This reaſon though it might ſafely be graunted, when as that which is of one nature is giuen to the whole perſon, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which manner being on earth, he was ſaid to be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, Iohn, 3, 13, according to his Godhead, for that whole Chriſt is euery where, though not <hi>the whole of Christ, totus Christus,</hi> though not <hi>totum Christi:</hi> yet becauſe their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is to proue it of the humaine nature, therefore they frame it thus.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:106"/>
            <p> The right hand of God is euery where.</p>
            <p>The humaine nature of Chriſt, is at the right hand of God: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The humaine nature of Chriſt is euery where, in ſo much as Iacobus Audred feareth not to ſay it is in a dunghill. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Aun. I wil ſhew the ſlightnes of this reaſon, by examples to the common people.</p>
            <p>This wheele is fiue or fixe yards about, this naile is in this wheele, therefore this naile is fiue or ſixe yards about.</p>
            <p>The Thames is below Greenwitch, and aboue King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</p>
            <p>London ſtandeth vpon the Thames.</p>
            <p>Therefore London ſtandeth below Greenwitch, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue Kingſton.</p>
            <p>The ayre is ouer all the earth.</p>
            <p>I am in the ayre, therefore ouer all the earth.</p>
            <p>Suffolk is from Newmarket to Ipſwitch.</p>
            <p>Bury is in Suffolk, therefore Bury is from Newmarket to Ipſwitch.</p>
            <p>The right hand of God is from eternity. Therefore the body of Chriſt <hi>Sadeel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I take exception againſt the forme of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for it ſhould be thus.</p>
            <p>The right hand of God is euery where.</p>
            <p>The body of Chriſt is at the right hand of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore the body of Chriſt is at that which is euery where.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ſay, heere is no cauſe for cauſe. For Chriſtes being at the right hand of God, cauſeth not the body to be euery where. That would infinitenes of Eſſence doe, and ſhould doe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I examine the propoſitions, and firſt the firſt, the right hand of God is euery where. If right hand be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for Gods power, and Eſſence, is it true, if it ſignifie ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie manifeſted glory (as I take it, it doth in this article) it is not true, for it is moſt fully manifeſted in the heauens. Euen from the firſt conception was the humaine nature ioyned
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1866:106"/>to the Godhead, but not in the ſence of this article, ſaid to be at the right hand of God the Father, the perſon not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the humaine nature.</p>
            <p>The Scripture by this article teacheth vs,</p>
            <p n="1">1 In no ſort to deſtroy the body of Chriſt, in holding that hee beeing at Gods right hand, hath his body euery where. For it is in heauen, Act, 3, 21.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That Chriſt is aboue Angels, and all creatures. 1, Pet. 3, 22.</p>
            <p n="3">3 To be aſſured that there can be no condemnation to vs, who are in Chriſt. Rom. 8, 34.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That we ſhall be ſure to perſeuer in grace, we haue an aduocate with the Father for vs, 1, Iohn, 2, 1.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That we muſt ſhake off all ſinne. Heb. 12, 2. It is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd that Chriſt ſhould make interceſſion to haue vs kept from ſinne, and the puniſhment thereof, and our ſelues to delight therein.</p>
            <p n="6">6 We muſt ſeeke the things which are aloft, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand, &amp;c. Col. 3, 1.</p>
            <p n="7">7 That we be perſwaded we ſit there with Chriſt, in title now, and ſhall afterward in full poſſeſſion. Eph. 2, 6.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Not to doubt of Chriſtes gathering, and gouerning his Church.</p>
            <p>The fourth, laſt, and higheſt degree, is, <hi>from thence hee ſhall, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Scriptures for the which are, not onely ſhewing it likely to be in puniſhing Adam, the world by the flood, Sodom and Gomorrha, but expreſſe and liuely places beſides, as Dan. 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>So as Chriſt ſpeaketh more plainly. Iohn, 5.22, 27. Which one day ſhall be executed, Math. 19, 28. as is more cleerely deliuered. Act, 17, 31.</p>
            <p>So as the manner is ſet down, Apoc, 20, 11, 12. Math, 25.</p>
            <p>Is commaunded to be preached, Acts, 10, 42. Whereof Paule maketh vſe. Rom, 14, 10, and 2, Cor, 5, 10.</p>
            <p>In ſomuch as not onely Acts 24, 26, but euen 2, Tim, 4, 1.</p>
            <p>And it appeareth, Heb, 6, 2, to haue been a poynt of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme.
<pb facs="tcp:1866:107"/>Howſoeuer many ſcoffed at it. 2, Pet, 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>Origen thinketh that the Prieſt had bels in the lower part of his robe, to put in mind of the end of the world.</p>
            <p>It is knowne what S. Ierom ſaid of himſelfe, <hi>whether I eate or drinke, or whatſoeuer I doe, mee thinketh I heare the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſounding, and a voyce ſaying, Ariſe yee dead, and come to iudgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The meaning will appeare out of the words, which offer three ſeuerall conſiderations, the place, the thing, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>The place <hi>from whence.</hi> This implieth the moſt high and glorious heauen.</p>
            <p>Queſt. But why fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen? An. Chriſt is now there, and in heauen it is not meete that wicked men and ſpirits ſhould be, though it were to receiue their iudgement.</p>
            <p>Que: Of whom is this meant? An. Of Chriſt, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his manhood can deſcend.</p>
            <p>Queſt. Whether ſhall he come? Aun. ſome thinke into the valley of Iehoſhaphat, according to Ioel, 3, 2.</p>
            <p>But there is but alluſion, &amp; Ioel ſpeaketh not there of the latter and generall, but of a neerer, and particuler iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Others thinke to the earth, there to iudge. Some good men haue thought thus.</p>
            <p>I loue not to ſtriue with any about matters little needfull, yet not ſpeaking to bind any mans conſcience, I thinke, not to the earth.</p>
            <p n="1">1 For that I remember no cleere place of ſcripture ſo ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="2">2 As alſo it may be doubted, whether the earth be large enough to receiue at once all men who haue been vpon it.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And laſtly, for that the ſcripture ſeemeth to ſay, that it ſhall be in the ayre, 1, Theſ. 4, 17.</p>
            <p>And in a glorious throne, Math, 5, 31. See alſo Reuel: 20, 11.</p>
            <p>Which is moſt likely ſo to be, for that then ſatan, who hath hetherto vſurped the princedome of the ayre, ſhal then
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1866:107"/>thence be caſt downe.</p>
            <p>The thing is <hi>comming to iudge.</hi> Where is the meane, &amp; the end.</p>
            <p>The meane, <hi>comming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are chiefly noted in ſcriptures two commings of Chriſt, 1 In the fleſh. 2 In glory. This is meant.</p>
            <p>This latter is expedient not only for manifeſting the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Chriſtes Godhead, but cleering the iuſtice of God.</p>
            <p>Sure, it ſhall be, whatſoeuer mockers doe thinke or ſay.</p>
            <p>The time is not ſet downe.</p>
            <p>It ſhall be moſt ſuddaine.</p>
            <p>It ſhall be in wonderfull glory, able to amaſe any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In which it is called the euill and terrible day. Amos, 6, 3.</p>
            <p>For if the time of grace be ſo, Mala, 4, much more this.</p>
            <p>And the rather, for that Gods preſence ſhall then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, who though hee come in fauour, yet ſtriketh great terror, as to Elias.</p>
            <p>It was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly thought, if one ſaw God, that he ſhould die, Gene, 16, 13, Gene, 32, 30, and Iudg, 13, 23.</p>
            <p>But when hee ſhall come in iuſtice, what terrors muſt there needes be?</p>
            <p>Thinke but of trowanting ſchollers, or ſlothfull ſeruants, looking for a ſeuere Maiſter, or of guiltie priſoners for an vpright Iudge, and then tell mee how great mens feare may be of God.</p>
            <p>For that none but haue ſome reliques of ſinnes, God bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinitely iuſt.</p>
            <p>Now this muſt needs be increaſed, by the thinking how God hath caſt the Angels into hell, and others, but alſo, in that the euent of this iudgement ſhall be for euer.</p>
            <p>One ſhall be perſonally called out, his owne thoughts his accuſers: his conſcience witneſſe againſt him, feare his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner.</p>
            <p>Now, when one ſhall ſee the brightneſſe of Gods maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie on the one part, and the vglineſſe of lothſome deuils on the other ſide, how may not this trouble, as Cyrill well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:108"/>
            <p> Not to appeare heere is impoſſible, to appeare may ſeeme to be intollerable.</p>
            <p>For whatſoeuer may trouble, will appeare. If it were but feare to the mind it were much. It will be ſights to the eyes, hearing to the eares, noyſome ſents of brimſtone to the ſmell; finally, it ſhal afflict the whole man.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the trouble that will ariſe vnto vs at others trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles increaſeth, when we ſhall heare the horrible ſcrichings of others, ſee their miſerable ſhifts in perplexitie, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but aſtoniſh.</p>
            <p>When all this ſhall be on a ſuddaine, how much more will it amaze?</p>
            <p>Neuer were wee in any terrible tempeſt of thunder and lightning?</p>
            <p>Looke to the Iſraelites, Exod, 19, 16, Habac, 3, 2.</p>
            <p>Thinke of the falſe terror at Oxford, at London, what will true doe?</p>
            <p>Eſpecially when Chriſt himſelfe, in whom all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is, is. Reue, 19, 12. And the manner as is Luke 21.</p>
            <p>The end is <hi>to iudge.</hi> This is ſometimes put for gouerning in generall, heere it ſignifieth two workes of iudgment, 1 Laying open all things: 2 Giuing ſentence vpon all things.</p>
            <p>The laying open, is whereby all things may be perceiued, not onely of God, but euen of our ſelues, as likewiſe (I take it) to others by our owne confeſſion.</p>
            <p>This laying open of all things, is by the booke of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Apoc, 20, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>And heere euery ſecret thing whatſoeuer ſhall be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered. Eccleſiaſ. 12, 14.</p>
            <p>The ſentence giuing, is whereby to euery one ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded whereto he may and muſt ſtand.</p>
            <p>The proceeding ſhal be according to the deeds: to teach what faith to truſt vnto, namely, that which worketh by loue. This ſentence, ſhall neuer bee reuerſed. Looke Math, 25, 46.</p>
            <pb n="42" facs="tcp:1866:108"/>
            <p> The perſons to be iudged, <hi>quick, and dead,</hi> that is, all, and euery one. Though now their bodies are conſumed,</p>
            <p n="1">1 The Scripture by this article teacheth vs to be ſetled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Atheiſts, and ſcoffers, in full perſwaſion of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle. 2, Pet. 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That ſince the Iudge ſhall come from heauen, we may before ſend thither our harts to meete him, &amp; in the meane while thence to looke for him. Phil. 3, 20.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Sithence Chriſt Ieſus ſhall be Iudge, beleeuers ſhould haue great comfort, ſo as they might wiſh for that day, and vnbeleeuers cannot chooſe but be affrighted, in that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to iudge, in whom they will not beleeue.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And ſeeing one, that is, he ſhall iudge vs all, we muſt not iudge or condemne one another, 1 Except we haue a calling thereto, 2 Not raſhly, 3 Not to determine pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily of their ſmall eſtate.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The ſuddainnes ſhould make vs preſently to be ready, and not put off from day to day.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Of the gloriouſnes and terriblenes muſt we make vſe. 1 To our ſelues, not quite to be out of hope, but rather of good courage in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As alſo to labour to be found in peace. 2, Pet. 3, 14. So may we be, if wee be in Chriſt, and haue truly turned to God. 2, Pet. 3, 14.</p>
            <p>If we keepe a good conſcience, Act, 24, 16. Pſal. 125.</p>
            <p>If we be often thinking of this day, and preparing againſt it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Towards others muſt we make vſe, as Paul, Act, 24, 26, but eſpecially, 2, Cor. 5, 11.</p>
            <p n="7">7 For that all things ſhall be layed open, wee muſt take heede of ſecret ſinnes, Eccleſi: 12, 14. Eph: 5, 12, 13, and euen of ſmall.</p>
            <p>As alſo to make much of a good conſcience.</p>
            <p n="8">8 And ſeeing the ſentence ſhall be according to works, labour for working faith.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The ſentence not being to be reuerſed, ſhould make vs carefull, that in death we might be cleared. For as death
<pb facs="tcp:1866:109"/>findeth, ſo ſhall iudgement.</p>
            <p>Thus farre of the ſecond perſon, now followeth of the third.</p>
            <p>Queſt. Is not that which is before, being beleeued, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſaluation, eſpecially ſeeing that the Scripture oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſayth, that beleeuing in Chriſt we ſhall be ſaued.</p>
            <p>Aun. The former is not enough, this miſterie of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie reuealed muſt be beleeued. And where it is ſaid belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in Chriſt ſuffiſeth, that is not meant to bar other doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, but to ſhew that beleeuing in Chriſt is moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which indeede is neuer without beleeuing in Father, &amp; holy Ghoſt, for that none can ſay that Ieſus is Chriſt, but by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Obiect: Some are ſaid, Act, 19. not to haue heard whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be an holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Aun. That is vnderſtood of the gifts of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Zonaras writeth in his 3, Tome, that this article was not put into this Creede, till the time of Macedonius the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique.</p>
            <p>This heritique denied about the yeere of Chriſt 364, the Godhead of the holy Ghoſt, againſt whom the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinopolitane counſell was gathered, and condemned him.</p>
            <p>It may be doubted whether Zonaras write true, for that it is in the Nicaene Creede, and in that of Athanaſius. Sure it is that the Scripture teacheth it, and till more queſtion was made of it, it was not ſo cleare as others.</p>
            <p>Where-vpon Gregory Nazianzen in an Epiſtle, writeth to Baſil thus, <hi>Teach vs how farre we ſhould in disputing about the Diuinitie of the holy Ghost, and what words we ſhould vſe, and how warily we are to behaue our ſelues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eraſmus was blamed by ſome for his boldnes this way, in ſaying that the Scripture did not call the holy Ghoſt God.</p>
            <p>But if it were as Zonaras writeth, ſurely theſe words of the Creede were not ioyned together by the Apoſtles, though the doctrine be Apoſtolical.</p>
            <p>Que. Doth not the placing of this article put ſome ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1866:109"/>betweene the perſons?</p>
            <p>Aun. No: it is onely for orders ſake, beſides, ſeeing the perſonall being of the holy Ghoſt, is of the Father, and Sonne, and the full manifeſtation thereof after Father and Sonne, therefore is it named after.</p>
            <p>The grounds of Scripture for it are, Gen. 1, 2. Where the holy Ghoſt is ſaid to doe like an Hen, to cheriſh and warme the creatures, and as it were to put life into them as to Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, which no creature can doe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The forme of Baptiſme doth manifeſtly proue this, Math. 28, 25, we are not baptized into that, but wherein we beleeue.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That prayer, 2, Cor. 13, 13. doth manifeſtly proue the ſame.</p>

            <p n="5">5 The contempt of the holy Ghoſt, is noted for a gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſinne. Heb, 10, 29.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt vnpardonable.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Iuſtin Martyr thinketh the doctrine of the holy Ghoſt ſo cleare, as that he thinketh that Plato knew it.</p>
            <p>The meaning wil appeare from the words knowne, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is repeated the profeſſion, and that wherein the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to beleeue.</p>
            <p>The profeſſion, and the meaning of it, looke at the firſt. It is heere repeated, for the long ſetting downe of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine touching Chriſt, as to imply that it is to be repeated to euery article particulerly.</p>
            <p>That <hi>in</hi> which the profeſſion ſayeth <hi>I doe beleeue,</hi> is <hi>the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghost.</hi>

            <p>Aun. Not onely for that it hath the common nature of God, but for that the being of it, is as inſpired or breathed, this in another word is called proceeding.</p>
            <p>Proceeding is whereby the holy Ghoſt partaketh the whole diuine Eſſence of God the Father, &amp; God the Son.</p>

            <p>Que. Doth not the Father and Sonne make holy?</p>
            <p>Aun. Yes: Iohn, 17, 17, 19, but by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>The contents of this article aunſwereth to this queſtion. What beleeueſt thou of the holy Ghoſt? I beleeue in the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>The things which the Scripture teacheth to beleeue, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the holy Ghoſt, are either of himſelfe, or of his works.</p>
            <p>Of himſelfe it teacheth to beleeue three points.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That the holy Ghoſt is God. This may appeare for that he is called Iehoua, compare Eſa 6, 9, with Act, 28, 25. And Ier. 31, 31, with the couenant in Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>He is called God, 1, Cor. 3, 16. 1, Cor. 6, 19, 20. 1, Cor. 12, 6, 11.</p>
            <p>He is euery where. Pſal: 139, 7.</p>
            <p>He knoweth all things, Iohn, 14, 26.</p>
            <p>He is almighty. Math. 12, 28.</p>
            <p>He createth and gouerneth all things, Gene. 1, 2. Pſalme, 104, 3.</p>
            <p>He is adored.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That the holy Ghoſt is a diſtinct perſon from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This may appeare, Math. 3, 16, Math. 28, 23. 2, Cor 13, 13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the holy Ghoſt is of the ſame ſubſtance, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with God the Father.</p>
            <p>Thus farre the things which the Scripture teacheth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1866:110"/>of the holy Ghoſt himſelfe, now follow thoſe which are touching his works, and heerein that I beleeue I ought 1 to haue ſome works, 2 to diſcerne them.</p>
            <p>That I ought to haue ſome works it appeareth, for that I cannot call the Lord Ieſus without the ſpirit, and if I haue not the ſpirit of Chriſt, I am none of Chriſtes.</p>
            <p>Theſe works can neuer wholely be left.</p>
            <p>The works I ought to haue in me (being of yeeres of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and hauing meanes) are to ſaluation.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Sauing knowledge of the wil of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Beleeuing the promiſes of God in Ieſus.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Regeneration or ſanctification to obedience of the whole Law, and word of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Leading into all truth. 5 Spiritual groweth, &amp; encreaſe.</p>
            <p>Diſcerne, we are commanded to try the ſpirits, 1, Ioh. 4, 1.</p>
            <p>Diſcerning teacheth firſt,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Whence theſe graces come, by meanes of the word.</p>
            <p>Athanaſius ſaith, <hi>Whereſoeuer the ſpirit is, he is by the word of Sacraments, prayer, company, conference.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 How they are diſcerned from counterfait. That wee ſhall finde, for that the ſpirit ſauing draweth all to the word. 2 Driueth to Chriſt, ſtirreth vp to ſanctification, not onely reſtraineth.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Howe they are to be cheriſhed, namely by the ſame meanes they were bred.</p>
            <p>Hitherto hath beene the doctrine to be beleeued concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God: now followeth that which is concerning the Church, to the end of the Creede.</p>
            <p>Well ſaith S. Auguſtine, <hi>the right order of confeſſion did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that after the Trinity, ſhould be ioyned the Church, as an houſe for the dweller, Gods Temple for himſelfe, the Citty for the first founder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all that is ſaid, and to be held of the Church, is as it is in it ſelfe, or in the gifts beſtowed vpon it.</p>
            <p>In it ſelfe <hi>the Church</hi> is <hi>holy, Catholique.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But firſt muſt the reading be cleared.</p>
            <p>There is a word to be repeated, the verbe, <hi>I beleeue.</hi> Of
<pb facs="tcp:1866:111"/>this we ſhal heere neede to repeate nothing.</p>
            <p>Queſt. It may be enquired, whether the word <hi>in,</hi> be not alſo to be repeated.</p>
            <p>Aun. No: the beſt coppies haue it not, in ſo much as the Catechiſme of the counſell of Trent refuſeth it. 2 The Church is a creature &amp; may not be truſted in. 3 Whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we truſt in, we may pray vnto, ſo muſt we not to the Church.</p>
            <p>Obict: The people are ſaid to haue beleeued in Moſes. Aun. Vnproperly.</p>
            <p>They beleeued that word which Moſes deliuered them from God, the word was Gods word.</p>
            <p>Onely that which we are ſaid to beleeue, muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that is the Church with the marks thereof.</p>
            <p>Now according to the courſe to be held, let vs conſider ſome Scriptures, where-vpon this doctrine touching the Church reſteth.</p>
            <p>And indeede for the prouing of this article, moſt of the Scriptures ſerue as likewiſe the chiefeſt works of God.</p>
            <p>God had his Church (in counſaile) from before the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world. Eph: 1, 4.</p>
            <p>This is the ſeede of the woman. Gen. 3, 15.</p>
            <p>Chriſt without this Church is as it were maymed, it being his body, he the head, Ephe. 1, 22. Ephe. 5, 23.</p>
            <p>Otherwiſe cannot the couenant of God be, which is made to the Church.</p>
            <p>And to omit further proofe, experience doth manifeſtly ſhew that there is ſuch a thing.</p>
            <p>Beſides, that the Church is <hi>holy,</hi> it is as cleare as the former, Ephe: 5, 2, 27.</p>
            <p>The Saints haue waſhed their garments in the blood of the Lambe, God doth ſo commaund.</p>
            <p>Without holines none ſhall ſee God, Heb. 12, 14.</p>
            <p>It is alſo <hi>Catholique,</hi> Apoca: 5, 9, 10. Heb. 12, 22. Eph. 3, 15.</p>
            <p>The meaning heereof wil ariſe from the right knowledge of the words, and thoſe 1 ſeuerally, 2 ioyntly.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:1866:111"/>
            <p> Church euery way is not taken alike. In common ſpeech the common people take it for a building for holy vſes, ſo is it the ſame with temple. It is not ſo to be vnderſtoode heere.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it is taken more generally, and ciuilly, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aſſembly, as Acts, 19, 39, 40, ſo muſt it not be taken heere.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it is taken ſpecially, and in the ſcriptures for the whole company of men and Angels, predeſtinate, choſen, called, iuſtified, ſanctified, and in their time to be glorified, Angels from the firſt, men after death.</p>
            <p>It hath the name in Greeke and Latine of calling out, and ſeuering from others, being indeede Gods choſen, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect company.</p>
            <p>The name in Engliſh (I take it) is of the Greeke <hi>Kyriake,</hi> as belonging to the Lord, for ſo it doth.</p>
            <p>For better vnderſtanding heereof, conſider the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church, and ſome properties.</p>
            <p>The diſtinctions are in words, not of the ſcripture, but of learned writers.</p>

            <p>Properly it ſignifieth as much as vniuerſall, not tied to one people in one Country, of one time, of one condition, &amp;c. So is it to be taken heere.</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:1866:112"/>
            <p> The Nicene Creede addeth Apoſtolique, that is holding the Apoſtles doctrine. This the Romaniſts wrongfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriat to themſelues.</p>
            <p>Iointly the words together carie this ſence, that euery one who profeſſeth this Creede,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Beleeueth that there is ſuch a company, as is ſpecified before.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That himſelfe is of the ſame company, Heb. 3, 1.1, Cor. 12, 13, Heb. 12, 22, 23.</p>
            <p>The things which we are to beleeue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the church, are whatſoeuer the word of God teacheth, which though we cannot reckon vp all in this ſhort manner of teaching, in ſhort time, and in right order, yet in the moſt neceſſary we will endeauour.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To iudge and thinke very highly of the Church, euen next God, not onely for the place it hath in the Creede, and order after the holy Ghoſt, but for the titles it hath, <hi>houſe of God, pillar and firmenes of truth, body of Christ, ſpouſe or wife of Christ.

            <p>Yet heere we muſt take heed that we think not too high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of the Church. As to iudge,</p>
            <p>Firſt, that it is aboue the ſcriptures, as the Papiſts in words teach, at leaſt ſome of them, and all, that the authority of the ſcriptures to vs ward, hangeth vpon the Church, and can no otherwiſe be knowne.</p>
            <p>The Church is founded vpon the ſcriptures, and Chriſt, not Chriſt vpon the Church.</p>
            <p>The authority of the ſcriptures is from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, or God in them, as the authority of a Princes deede is from the Prince himſelfe, not from any other witnes. So doeth light cauſe it ſelfe to be ſeene, as the euidence of ſcriptures ſhew themſelues to be ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>Que. Doth the Church nothing to the ſcriptures?</p>
            <p>Aun. Yes: 1 It keepeth the Roles and Records of the ſcripture.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It diſcerneth canonicall from Apocriphall, it maketh none canonicall.</p>
            <p n="3">

            <p n="4">4 It expoundeth, and openeth the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to hold that the Church cannot erre.</p>
            <p>For better vnderſtanding whereof, wee muſt know that ſome part of the Church is in heauen, and that indeede can not erre: the other is on earth, of this doe we ſpeake heere, this can and doth erre, being a viſible company, wherein are mixt bad with good.</p>
            <p>Yea, it may erre iudicially, as the falſe Prophets to Achab, the Scribes and Phariſies againſt Chriſt.</p>
            <p>So as that it is no good ſaying, this ſaith the Church, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is to be beleeued.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to hold that the ſafeſt way from all error, is, to hold to the Church.</p>
            <p>True it is indeede, it is ſafe being in the Church viſible, whereof this is ſaid: but the ſafeſt is to hold to Chriſt, and the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Neuer to doubt, but that there is, and ſhall be a Church for euer. So as that it is not poſſible it ſhould all, alwayes be feene, for ſome part are vnborne, ſome are in heauen, and very few ſometimes haue beene on earth, and could not be knowne to be of the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Thoroughly to take knowledge of the nature of the Church, which wee beleeue, and is not onely a company profeſſing Chriſtian faith, hauing the ſame Sacraments, and lawfull paſtors, vnder one head the Pope: but as we heard before, predeſtinate to glory, in time called, iuſtified, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and glorified.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That Chriſt is the onely head of this Church.</p>
            <p n="5">5 To know the proper markes of a true viſible Church. Theſe are the word, ſacraments, prayer, good life.</p>
            <p>When I ſay the word, I meane the pure text, in the pure ſence of it, and the ſacraments in lawfull adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>Que. Whether then is the Church of Rome a true viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church?</p>
            <p>Aun. No: For though it keepe a coppie of the Bible text, yet it is with great corruption, neither in the true and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1866:113"/>proper expoſition. For their body of doctrine, which they would fetch from the ſcriptures, ouer-turneth the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in their idolatry of the maſſe, worſhipping ſaints, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, their iuſtification by works, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Obiect. They haue baptiſme, Aun. They ſhould haue it with the word, ſo haue they it not. 2 They haue Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, as a theefe might ſteale away the great ſeale, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out authority ſet it to writing, no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6 That we ſhould ioyne in communion with a true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church (a true viſible Church I call, that hath the marks as before, holding the foundation of ſaluation, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) and muſt not ſeuer our ſelues there from. Indeede we muſt not conſent to ſinne, or diſcent in loue.</p>
            <p n="7">7 That wee muſt labour to be true members of this Church, which heere we beleeue.</p>
            <p>So ſhall we doe, by giuing all diligence to make our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and chooſing ſure. Calling implieth ſetting in ſauing knowledge, faith, and obedience.</p>
            <p n="8">8 That the Church is not appropriated to any people, place, time: So as the Romaniſts doe fondly, who would haue vs beleeue the Catholique Romaine Church. As if one ſhold ſay the French Paris or Engliſh London church, whereas beſides the Romaine, is no particular Church.</p>
            <p n="9">9 That all who profeſſe themſelues of the Church, muſt be holy, and grow in holines.</p>

            <head>AN EXPOSITION vpon the 119 Pſalme.</head>
            <p>THE 119 Pſalme is moſt heauenly, and deſerueth in ſpeciall ſort to be wel knowne, remembred, &amp; found by experience in euery of our harts.</p>
            <p>It hath ſo many parts or ſtaues (the moſt learned call them <hi>Octonaries,</hi> for that they haue eight lines or verſes in them) as there be letters in the Hebrew Alphabet, euery verſe of euery ſtaffe beginning with the ſame.</p>
            <p>Whereby is declared vnto vs, 1 The diligence of the penner, that with very carefull meditation it was framed. 2 The worth of the Pſalme in that the ſpirit fretteth, and enameleth it with theſe Characters. 3 And deſire that the Reader ſhould remember it, being thus in order of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſet downe. The ſame courſe is in other places of Scripture, Pſal. 25, Pſal. 34, Pſal. 37. Pſal. 111, Pſal. 112. The Prouerb. 31, Lamentations of Ieremie, for the ſame ends.</p>
            <p>This Pſalme containeth truth, and doctrines of diuers ſorts: the which to range in their orders, and fitly to ſunder, is ſomewhat hard, and not very neceſſary.</p>
            <p>It is altogether (as a man may terme it) a chriſtall (not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering glaſſe) of all true godlines, or a touchſtone of all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere harted worſhippers of God, &amp; liuely anatomie of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open of a good ſoule. Whereto the more one can find himſelfe like, the more mercy hath he found of God, and oweth him the more praiſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſtaffe or octonarie, ſetteth out vnto vs a good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>The more <hi>at large, or in generall ſetting forth of a good and godly perſon,</hi> is in the three firſt verſes: and that after two
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1866:114"/>ſorts. 1 From the duties of this party, 2 From the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his eſtate.</p>
            <p>The duties are ſixe, two and two linked together in euery verſe.</p>
            <p>The commendation: that ſuch parties are bleſſed.</p>
            <p>But before wee can as we ſhould with profit conſider of this, or other ſuch places of ſcriptures, where morrall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are commended or commaunded, ſomewhat before hand muſt be knowne.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that though no word be ſpoken of Chriſt, it muſt alwayes be vnderſtood, that he is the full, and onely cauſe of euery of our ſaluations.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That theſe and ſuch like duties are then commended in any party, when the party is firſt in Chriſt, that is, for Chriſtes ſake hath pardon of his ſinnes, and imputation of accounting of true righteouſnes, otherwiſe not.</p>
            <p n="3">3 They muſt come from faith working them for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to Godward, for the deed done only neuer pleaſeth God.</p>
            <p n="4">4 In this and ſuch like places, are not the cauſes why one is happy (ſo is hee onely for Chriſt) but the ſignes which ſhew that he is happy.</p>
            <p n="5">5 They muſt not be vnderſtoode in the rigour &amp; ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the morrall law, but for the continuall deſire, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and endeauour to doe them, and ſorrowing when we cannot doe them, &amp; if we faile, to aske pardon, &amp; ſet a freſh vpon them, alwayes labouring to proue better &amp; better.</p>
            <p n="6">6 That all defects and blemiſhes, for Chriſtes ſake, are, and ſhall be pardoned.</p>

            <p n="2">2 For warrantable cariage in, or vſage of that kinde of life.</p>
            <p>Where-vpon we may perceaue: that,</p>
            <p n="1">1 The ſcripture would haue none inuent courſes of life, they muſt take them as their way left of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 As in the way one may meete with many inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, againſt which he prepareth, ſo ſhall he in his life, ſo as none ſhould euer hope alwayes to be ſecure.</p>
            <p n="3">3 If in way he goe not forward, he is neuer the better, ſo if we doe not encreaſe in goodnes, we loyter in our life.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Our Countrey and home is in heauen: let vs not ſet downe our ſtaues heere.</p>
            <p n="1">1 This way is ſuch, as that it is one, pointed out by the ſcriptures, walked in by direction of them, bringing to one home. So ſaith Ier. 32, 39.</p>
            <p>Wherefore he blameth them who goe about to change their wayes, Ier. 2.36. looke Pſal. 125, 5.</p>
            <p>Euery one ſhall not be ſaued, walking in his particular way, what ſo euer it be, as the Turkes thinke, and Atheiſts would haue it.</p>
            <p>He muſt enquire of the old way, Ier: 6, 16. and know that that is the way, and walke in it. Eſa, 30, 21.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This way is ſuch as euery one muſt walke in it.</p>
            <p>Well therefore haue the tranſlatours ſet downe the word <hi>their;</hi> which is not in the Hebrew, to open the meaning of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1 No man muſt be inordinate, or out of a calling.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Not ſo buſie to cenſure others, as firſt to looke to him ſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vpright,</hi> the Hebrew word is <hi>Temime.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word <hi>Tam,</hi> whereof it commeth, doth ſignifie

                  <item>vnproperly.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>It ſignifieth properly, when it is put for a thing perfect in the kinde of it, ſo as it wanteth nothing: ſo is the law of God ſaid to be, Pſal, 19, 18, &amp; ſo <hi>Thummim</hi> in Aarons breſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1866:115"/>repreſenting Chriſtes full holines.</p>
            <p>It ſignifieth vnproperly, when it is put for a thing where ſomewhat is wanting, though it come very neere, or ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth to come neere to full perfection: as often is ſeene in many places of the ſcriptures. So was Noah, Iob, <hi>Tam,</hi> or perfect, though they wanted ſomewhat.</p>
            <p>So is it taken in this place. For the moſt vpright in the world (Chriſt onely excepted) haue not had all.</p>
            <p>So as that the ſuppoſed perfection of <hi>Pelagian</hi> or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Catholique, cannot warrant it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now this which ſignifieth ſomewhat vnproperly, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe taken two wayes: 1 for ſincerity. 2 Vnblameable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</p>
            <p>For ſincerity, as 1, Kings, 9, 4.</p>
            <p>And is quite contrary to hypocriſie.</p>
            <p>Hypocriſie is moſt naturall, diſpleaſing God, hard to diſcry in a mans owne ſelfe, and will creepe into euery good duty toward God or man. And yet for all that, men muſt not be hypocrites, but ſincere. Which the better to know, conſider what is ſincerity, how neceſſary, how to be tried, how to be kept.</p>
            <p>Sincerity or vprightnes in this place firſt meant, is confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the whole man, with ſound and full information to euerlaſting life.</p>
            <p>This information is in the truth of God, well vnderſtood and beleeued.</p>
            <p>The whole man is ſoule and body, thoughts, will, &amp; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes at all times.</p>
            <p>Conformity is faſhioning all things according to ſound truth.</p>
            <p>A ſincere man is like a chriſtall glaſſe, with a light in the middeſt, which appeareth through euery part thereof: ſo as that truth within, breaketh out in euery parcell.</p>
            <p>Sincere men therefore, 1 are in euery thing alike.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Shine from the heart within. 3 Cannot poſſibly lie hid.</p>
            <p>It is ſo neceſſary, as nothing without it can pleaſe God.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:116"/>
            <p> What the fruites of it be, looke Prouerb. 2, 7, 21, Prouer. 10, 9, Prouerb. 11, 3, 6, 20, Prouer. 28, 6, 10, 18, Pro. 2, 9, 10.2, Cor. 1, 12.</p>
            <p>A man may try whether it be in himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 If hee account of things according to their nature, of great, greatly. Hypocrites will ſtraine Gnats, and ſwallow Cammels, will be curious in ceremonies, and omit greater things: ſincerity will in their place regard both. Therefore ſerueth the true light in the hart.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If he be moſt ſeuere towards himſelfe. Hypocrites are moſt hard to others: looke Iohn, 8, 3. Math. 7, 3. the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt are moſt fauourable, as being priuie to the in bred cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. So was Iob toward his children, tollerating their banquetting, though himſelfe were not with them. Ioſeph toward Mary with child, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3 If he be more carefull to pleaſe God then all the world beſide: Hypocrites doe all things to be ſeene of men, make more of the reputation of the world, then the witneſſe of their owne conſcience.</p>
            <p n="4">4 If he be willing to beare aduertiſements, admonitions, reprehenſions. A ſincere party meaneth wel from his hart, and therefore can be content to be called vpon: the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite is vnſound at the hart, and cannot abide to be gaged, he is touched on the gall, ſo did the Iewes to Stephen. Act, 7, 54.</p>
            <p n="5">5 It is impoſsible to be ſmothered, it will breake open, &amp; cannot lie hid: hypocrites are couchant, &amp; can haue a faire gloue on a foule hand.</p>
            <p>This is kept and preſerued, 1 by the ſincere milke of the word, 1, Pet. 1, 2. and continuall deſire to be enformed in the ſound truth.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The more one endeauoureth to ſearch and ſound him ſelfe, the better ſhal he preſerue his ſincerity. Standing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters corrupt.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Often ſetting of a mans ſelfe in the preſence of God, and before his iudgement ſeate.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the firſt acception, the other followeth,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1866:116"/>which is vnblameablenes: not that the ſeruant of God ſhal not ſometimes be charged with ſomewhat amiſſe, or ſhall not in a ſlip be ouer-taken: but,</p>
            <p>Vnblameablenes is ſuch vprightnes, whereby a mans life cannot be noted with any raigning ſinne after his effectuall calling: ſo was Samuel, Iob, Paule, and ſome others, as Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth and Zacharie. Luk, 1.</p>
            <p>Now both theſe, ſincerity, and vnblameablenes, muſt be in one party, and in all the life. But ſome may ſay, that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible: for aunſwer heereto, looke the fift and ſixt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall remembrance, in the beginning of this Pſalme.</p>
            <p>Now by this before, we learne, that,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Vprightnes of ſincerity, and vnblameablenes, as it is moſt neceſſary, ſo ſhould it be with the firſt, or elſe all will be vnſound, neither would the Prophet haue ſet it firſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And that we muſt iudge of our ſelues, and others, by vprightnes in the way, that is vocation of a Chriſtian, or any other more eſpeciall: the world doth otherwiſe, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend for things that are not of a mans calling.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the firſt duty, the commendation follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> that is, ſuch parties are happy, or happineſſes, that is, many bleſsings belong to ſuch, or it is, and ſhall be happily to ſuch, for ſo many wayes may the word be taken.</p>
            <p>The Prophets meaning is, that ſuch parties are in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate moſt to be liked, and longed for: as the world count happy thoſe in whoſe ſteedes they could wiſh themſelues.</p>
            <p>I thinke it not the fitteſt heere to diſpute of bleſſednes, what it ſhould be, or what good things it containeth in it, that is not the Prophets meaning. Whoſoeuer would know this, for the cauſe of bleſſednes, let them looke Pſal. 32, 2, Rom. 4, 7, and for the fruites the beginning of the 26 of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit. and 28 of Deutrono.</p>
            <p>This bleſſednes which is heere named, hath two degrees in
<list>
                  <item>this life.</item>
                  <item>the life to come.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Bleſſednes in this life, may be called bleſſednes of grace.</p>
            <p>Bleſſednes in the life to come, of glory: of theſe haue one,
<pb facs="tcp:1866:117"/>and be ſure of both.</p>
            <p>Heere though, is principally meant bleſſednes of grace, whereto a man may reach in this life, as alſo Mat. 5, 2, 3, &amp;c. Math. 13, 16, Pro. 28, 14,</p>
            <p>That vpright men are happy, it is moſt certaine, no vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes, but by the ſpirit of ſanctification, no ſanctification without iuſtification, no iuſtification without forgiuenes of ſinnes, wherein is bleſſednes. Pſal. 32.2. Rom. 4.7. God is vpright mens ſhield, Prouerb, 2, 7. The Lord delighteth in them. Prouer. 11, 20. What can be more. And if hypocrites be ſo curſed, as indeede they are, ſincere cannot chooſe but be moſt happy. Was it not this, that made God fauour Noah, Iob, &amp;c. Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1 They greatly erre, who thinke the godly of all men moſt miſerable.</p>
            <p n="2">2 All happy men are in a ſure eſtate, that cannot be loſt. Happines of grace is ſurer then of nature. That was in our owne keeping, and was loſt. This is in Gods fauour, which is vnchangeable, and cannot miſcarie.</p>
            <p>So as that all vpright men may haue ſound conſolation, that they neuer ſhall faile.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Vpright men may haue many afflictions, as indeede they haue, as Abraham, Iſaack, Iacob, Dauid, Abel, &amp;c. yet are they bleſſed.</p>
            <p>So as that no outward or inward afflictions, of what kind ſo euer, can hinder an vpright mans happines. Nay they ſhal further it. Math. 5, 10.</p>
            <p>Wherfore iudge no man by his afflictions to be out of the fauour of God, elſe might Lazarus haue beene thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe of.</p>
            <p n="4">4 If vpright perſons are happy, then hypocrites and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious ſinners are wretched, and yet enioy they much out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proſperity.</p>
            <p>Outward good things therefore, doe not alwayes ſhew that a man is happy.</p>
            <p n="5">5 And ſeeing that vpright men are happy, who would not labour to be vpright, though it coſt him (as it wil great)
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1866:117"/>neuer ſo much endeuour?</p>
            <p>Hitherto hath beene the firſt duty &amp; commendation of it, now followeth the ſecond, which is, <hi>Walking in the law of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houa,</hi> ſet out by the parties in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is, who are ſaid to walk.</p>
            <p>In this duty are two things to be conſidered, 1 The prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of <hi>walking.</hi> 2 The forme or rule, <hi>in the law of Iehoua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>walke,</hi> is a borrowed word, as that before of the <hi>way:</hi> and ſignifieth the ordering of life, and hath in it two things. 1 That as in a way there are many ſteps to be ſet, ſo are there ſundry particulars in life.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That as in the way, euery ſtep muſt be ordered, ſo muſt euery particular of life be.</p>
            <p>Of the particulars which are in life, there is 1 the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or head of the way, the hart. 2 Paſſages on fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hart.</p>
            <p>The hart is to be vnderſtood the ſoule, that is minde and will, from whence as from the hart of the body naturall life commeth, ſo the beginning of godly life muſt proceede.</p>
            <p>The ſoule therefore muſt as the firſt ſtep, be ſet in the law of God, out of which if it ſtand, all other things run ryot.</p>
            <p>This is the more to be thought of, for that the hart by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is turned from God. 2 It is very hard to recall it, &amp; fixe it. 3 And being once ſet, will eaſily draw the whole man.</p>
            <p>Paſſages from this fountaine &amp; head, are 1 Kinds of life. 2 Duties of life.</p>
            <p>Kinds of life, are particular callings. Euery one muſt be warrantable by the word of God.</p>
            <p>Duties of life are the practiſes and works of ones calling, generall, or ſpeciall. Of which ſort are,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Thoughts. A motion without conſent.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Affections, motions with ſome kinde of feeling, as ioy, hope, feare, loue, hatred, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Actions, wherein beſides ſome inward conceite, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what is performed, and theſe are of ſundry ſorts.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Naturall: ſuch as are for the neceſſity of life, as eating, drinking, ſleeping, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Domeſticall, ſuch as are belonging to the family, as of husband, wife, father, children, maiſter, ſeruant.</p>

            <p n="5">5 Ludicrous, which are of recreation, and diſport.</p>
            <p>In euery of theſe, euery ſtep (as it were) is carefully to be ordered: neyther is it ſufficient to haue a generall good meaning to pleaſe God, vnleſſe we endeuour in euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>Salomon commaundeth vs to looke to our feete, Eccle. 4, 17, &amp; Paul chargeth we ſhould walke circumſpectly, looke Pſal. 119, 105, Pſal. 139, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Hereby it appeareth, 1 that they doe not their duty, who onely carry a generall purpoſe to doe well, vnleſſe they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour the ſame in particuler.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That none can be too carefull of his walking, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his life, ſo as it is a falſe charge to count any too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And that if euery particular ſhould be looked vnto, a man had neede of great knowledge and wiſedome out of the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the practiſe of walking, now followeth the forme or rule, whereto this walking is to be framed, <hi>in the law of Iehouah,</hi> which ſo is to be vnderſtoode, as that it muſt be alone: ſo Pſalme 1, 2. and Pſal, 119, 97, for indeede there is none who can preſcribe a ſufficient rule but onely God, whoſe wiſedome and iuſtice is aboue all creatures.</p>
            <p>Heere therfore is thruſt out, 1 nature which (the Stoicks ſay) if we follow as a guide, we ſhall neuer doe amiſſe. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is corrupt.</p>
            <p>The beſt life in this kinde, is but ciuill, which indeede nowe a dayes in the world doth carry the greateſt ſhew, where onely appearance preuaileth.</p>
            <p>It is a moſt dangerous courſe, not for that it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but for that moſt commonly it abandoneth all power of true godlines.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And ſeeketh only the report for honeſty among men.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:1866:119"/>
            <p> It differeth from true Chriſtian life, becauſe that ciuill life hangeth vpon the reputation of men, which if it obtaine, it is content, Chriſtian life is ordered by faith, that is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the word, and application of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Ciuill life reſpecteth men moſt, Chriſtian life endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to pleaſe God.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Ciuill life is not very carefull of religious duties, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life is in publique, and priuate, the other not much.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Ciuil life maketh no great conſcience of ſmaller ſinnes, as in ſwearing leſſe oathes, idlenes, gaming. Chriſtian life doth.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Ciuill life neuer taketh any care to reſiſt the ſinnes of the time, Chriſtian doth.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Heere is remoued euery mans owne particular courſe, which he ſetteth to himſelfe, and pleaſeth himſelfe in. Iere. 44, 17.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Other folkes example is not a ſufficient rule.</p>
            <p>The ſufficient rule is, <hi>the law of Iehoua,</hi> for the kinde, it is <hi>a law,</hi> for the Author, it is <hi>of Iehoua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The law is heere, the word of God, and is taken particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly for the 10 Commaundements, or fiue bookes of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Generally, for the whole Bible.</p>
            <p>It is taken generally in this place, as elſe where, 1, Pſal. 2. Pſal, 19, 7, heere-vpon ſinne is counted tranſgreſsion of the law, that is, breach of the word of God written.</p>
            <p>Now this name of law is to be vnderſtood, as of the whole body of the ſcriptures, ſo of euery particular branch thereof, in ſo much as euen particular examples many times haue the force of generall doctrine. Marke then that,</p>
            <p n="1">1 The Papiſts erre who teach that ſome parts of the word of God are but counfailes, which a man may follow if hee will, and that all are not lawes, whereto one is bound.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That as ſubiects are bound to take knowledge of the lawes of the Land, ſo are they of the word of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And ſeeing that men will looke to the lawes of the Land, why ſhould they not much more to this?</p>
            <p n="4">4 So reade, heare, and thinke of the word of God, as of
<pb facs="tcp:1866:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>the law of thy life.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That as euery law broken hath ſome penalty or other, ſo hath the law of God.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the Author, <hi>Iehoua,</hi> Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, know one well, know all well, know not all, know none.</p>
            <p>Where-vpon it followeth, that the Iewes or Turks lawes which they boaſt of, neither of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> acknowledging Chriſt, and the holy Ghoſt, is not to be counted the law of God. For the word of God wrongly vnderſtood, is not the word of God.</p>
            <p>Nor ſurely the Papiſts doctrine, miſvnderſtanding many fundamentall grounds touching Chriſt: ſo as that none that is not orthodoxicall, cannot properly be ſaid to haue this.</p>
            <p>This law is ſaid to be <hi>Iehoua,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1 He maketh it. 2 He can beſt iudge of the breaking or keeping of it. 3 He onely can diſpence againſt it.</p>
            <p>Wee gather then, 1 that no exception can be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this law, for wiſedome, iuſtice, equity.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That being Gods, it muſt be ſpiritually vnderſtood.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That wee remember God taketh knowledge of euery ſtep that is awry.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That we muſt approue all our obedience to him, and doe all for his ſake.</p>
            <p n="5">5 And that it being ſaid that they walke in his law, the meaning is, that alwayes and in euery place they ſo doe.</p>
            <p>Now with this ſecond duty ſhould be repeated the word bleſſed, as indeede with euery other of the foure which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but it may ſuffice to haue opened it once for all. Thus much of the two duties in the firſt verſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond verſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The two duties are, 1 <hi>Keeping his,</hi> that is, <hi>Iehouahs testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi> 2 <hi>Seeking him,</hi> that is, <hi>Iehouah with their whole hart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the former of theſe two, which is the third generall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, are 1 obiect, or thing where about the endeauour is.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1866:120"/>
               <hi>His testimonies.</hi> 2 Act, the endeuour or practiſe about this thing. <hi>Keeping.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Teſtimonie, for matter and meaning, is the ſame with law, in the verſe going before, to wit, the written word of God: ſo is it likewiſe taken, Pſal. 197, and elſe where.</p>
            <p>Now yet for the vſe of this name <hi>testimonies</hi> heere, for better vnderſtanding of it, it ſeemeth that teſtimonie or wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, is a word which cannot well be vnderſtoode, without reference or reſpect to ſome other. Where-vpon as the things are diuers, which may be reſpected, ſo may the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſence of this word be.</p>
            <p>It is vſed in reſpect 1 of man to man. 2 Of man to God. And that ſeuerally or ioyntly, when GOD witneſſeth to man, or man to God, or both to each other.</p>
            <p>Heere I iudge it to be, to be vnderſtoode betweene God and man ioyntly, and mutually, whereby God witneſſeth to man, and man to God. Now this ariſeth from the compact or couenant, which is betweene God, and his people.</p>
            <p>For ſo doe God and man couenant. Looke Ier: 31, 31. God promiſing to take the people for his, that is to fauour them euery way for things of this life, and of that which is to come: the people promiſing againe, to acknowledge &amp; worſhip God according to his will.</p>
            <p>This couenant he likewiſe maketh with particular men, Gen. 17, 7, 10, ſo is God called the God of Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob. Heere-vpon is that of the Ark of the teſtimonie, Exod. 30, 6, and Pſal. 122, 4, as a witnes of this couenant, and for that the tables of the couenant, or witneſſes of this coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, were in it, Heb. 9, 4. Act, 7, 44.</p>
            <p>So that the written law of God is the witnes or teſtimonie of the wil of God toward vs, &amp; of our profeſſion of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie towards him. So when God had publiſhed his law, the people profeſſed whatſoeuer the Lord commaunded, that would they doe. Deut. 5, 27.</p>
            <p>Where-vpon we are to take the proclamation of the law, Exod. 20, not ſo much for the very couenant of ſaluation, (which is but one founded on Chriſt) as for the articles or heads of the conuention &amp; agreement betweene God and
<pb facs="tcp:1866:121"/>man. Theſe things God requireth, theſe things man will performe by himſelfe, or Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Neither is this name of teſtimonies more to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode of the whole body of the law, then of euery branch and clauſe of it, which witneſſeth the former.</p>
            <p>So as that theſe teſtimonies are mutuall, declaring on Gods part, not why he is our God, but what he requireth of vs: and on ours, not why we are receaued (for that is for Chriſt) but what we deſire to doe.</p>
            <p>That God thus witneſſeth it is cleare, Deut. 4, 45, theſe are the witneſſes, &amp;c. where the Geneuans note, that is, the articles and points of the couenant: ſo Deut. 6, 17, ſo Pſal. 19, 8.</p>
            <p>That his people likewiſe doe witnes. Reade Ioſh: 24, 22. Deut. 5, 27.</p>
            <p>Sundry vſes ariſe from hence, and firſt from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe teſtimonies: 1 on Gods part to vs ward. That,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Our chiefe care ſhould be to be in league with God, which is to vs the fountaine of all good things, and without the which we can neither looke for, and ſhall be ſure to find no good thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2 So muſt we reade, and heare the word, as the articles which God requireth we ſhould ſubſcribe vnto: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had neede well to vnderſtand them.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It is a couenant of ſpeciall account, where are ſo many witneſſes and articles, and ſo many good things offered there-with.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That God cannot but take knowledge of the violating of it, and greeuouſly puniſh it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 On our parts who are Gods people.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Euery ſeruant of God taketh vpon him to obſerue eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie clauſe of the Bible, according to the wil of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Euery ſinner witneſſeth againſt himſelfe, hee denieth his owne deede and agreement: he had ſubſcribed to the word of God, and by ſinning now ſeemeth to denie his owne hand.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:1866:121"/> 3 Where-vpon it needes muſt follow, that their owne conſcience condemneth them.</p>

            <p>Now foloweth the act or practiſe of <hi>keeping:</hi> wherein are ſundry things.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Hauing the bookes of canonicall ſcripture, in their beſt originall, or tranſlated copies.</p>

            <p n="6">6 Continuall practiſe of them in life.</p>

            <p>As he is in himſelfe, we can neuer finde out (which is the end of ſeeking) and though we could, yet would it helpe but little.</p>
            <p>But as he ſheweth himſelfe to vs, wee may in ſome ſort finde, and muſt ſearch. Looke Deut. 29, 29. Ier. 9, 24: ſo Exod. 34.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:1866:122"/>1, 20. Act, 14, 17.</p>
            <p>So as that neyther men nor deuils are ignorant of him in part, who for all that doe not walke in his law. Titus. 1, 16.</p>
            <p>Indeede it is neceſſary that thus wee ſhould know God, but it is not ſufficient.</p>
            <p>Heere the Prophet ſetteth out a peculiar ſtate, wherein is bleſſednes, a man that knoweth the Creator may be wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. Dauid ſetteth downe a proper marke: knowledge of the Creator is common.</p>
            <p>So as that though to ſeeke God the Creator be required, yet it will not ſuffice.</p>
            <p>Therefore are we in the ſecond ſence to vnderſtand <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houa</hi> heere, to wit, as he hath bewrayed himſelfe toward vs a Redeemer and Sauiour. Wherein indeede is eternall life, which if we ſeeke not, we ſhall not finde heauen. Him did the wiſe men ſeeke, him Mary and others.</p>
            <p>Now in ſeeking of God our Redeemer and Sauiour, ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things are requiſite.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The truth of ſaluation and doctrine of the will, God touching that: ſo Ier: 9, 23, 24.</p>
            <p>This conſiſteth in the articles of Chriſtian faith, the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ground whereof is Chriſt, and thorough knowledge of him, 1, Cor. 2, 2, Phil. 3, 8, which truth, then may be in ſome ſort to be in vs: when we can,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Diſcerne wholeſome doctrine from vnwholſome and vnſound.</p>
            <p>Wholeſome is that which nouriſheth, and feedeth to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life: ſo is not all truth. Chriſtes ſheepe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore know his voyce.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Haue grounds and texts of Scripture, where-vpon we build, whereto wee can haue recourſe, and not ſtart from them.</p>

            <p>The duties are: 1 Entrance to the throane of grace, Heb. 4, 16. Rom. 5, 2, which is when being animated by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, we can come into the preſence of God, &amp; pray vnto him.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Patient and reioycing minde, euen in the croſſe, vpon perſwaſion of the loue of God. Rom. 5, 3.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Vpon perſwaſion of Gods fauour, to ſhew fauour to others.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Him muſt we ſeeke to obay. Pſal, 24, 4, 5, 6. Without which all ſeeking is looſing.</p>

            <p>All and euery of theſe reſpects in <hi>Iehoua,</hi> muſt we haue, elſe ſhall not we ſeeke as we ſhould.</p>
            <p>So as that all idle queſtions are heere to be remoued, and worldly ſearching. God knowne pacified, obeyed muſt be: which we are to finde out.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the thing to be ſought, now followeth the endeuour. <hi>Seeking with the whole hart.</hi> Wherein is, 1 the action. 2 The adiunct.</p>

               <hi>Largely,</hi> in regard of more duties then one, euen of the whole lawe of God. And that after two ſorts, 1 Legally. 2 Euangelically.</p>
            <p>The legall acception of <hi>whole hart,</hi> is when it is taken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſence, and intent of the whole morrall law of God, and then it ſignifieth the perfection of all duties in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1866:123"/>manner and forme, both for the number and meaſure of them. Which neuer any man performed but Adam before the fall, and Chriſt ſince, neyther indeede can any man. So that it is not to be vnderſtoode heere, for the Prophet ſpeaketh of poſsibility, and practiſe, elſe could no ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be bleſſed.</p>
            <p>The euangelicall acception is, when it is ſo taken, as that by the doctrine of the Goſpell, and ſpirit of Chriſt, a party is ſo renued, as that he can performe it acceptably to God. Which is: when,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Chriſtes full performance is imputed to the party.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The parties hart is renued to 1 deſire, 2 purpoſe, 3 en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour thus to doe, 4 with continuance and encreaſe. In which ſence heere are we to vnderſtand it. So as none with theſe is to be diſcouraged, if he can riſe after many foiles.</p>
            <p>This may a man ſomewhat perceaued in himſelfe. If,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt in time and order generally for a mans whole life, and particularly for euery day he ſeeke God, as wee haue ſhewed before, and that moſt earneſtly.</p>
            <p n="2">2 He ſeeke God for himſelfe, and other things for God, neuer caring for any things more then they helpe to God, or are with, or aſſure Gods fauour vnto vs.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Hee had rather leeſe all, yea his owne life then the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God.</p>
            <p>This he may be little and little ſee in loſſe of fauour, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, honour, profit, reputation, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>not, no prayſe is it. Therefore if Dauid had forborne when he might haue ſent his Minions for Bathſheba, and had her in his ſecret chamber, he had done well. Cain is not to be commended for with-holding his hands from Abel, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Father, when that after he ſlew him in the field. The Patriarches if they had not ſold Ioſeph, when they had him in their hands, and Ziba not accuſed Mephiboſheth, when he could not ſpeak in his own defence, had wel done.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Others, a man may commit though none know: the forbearing of theſe is not doing iniquitie. Therefore did Gehezai, Cain, Achan, Dauid, Ananias, and Saphira, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit iniquity though it was in ſecret. No, though it were poſſible to commit iniquity, and God not know, yet for the filthines of it, muſt it be auoyded.</p>
            <p>Now follow ſome other kinds of iniquity: againſt

                  <item>God and his law.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Both theſe becauſe all agree they ſhould be ſhunned, we ſhall not neede to ſpeake of.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Some iniquity there is, which in more ſort ſpeciall may counted ones owne, whereto his naturall diſpoſition encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, cuſtome carrieth, kind of life draweth: ſo haue ages, ſteps, callings, ſundry iniquities, which they are more in danger of, then others: theſe muſt be forborne. Pſal. 18, 24. ſmall praiſe is it for old men not to offend in young mens ſinnes, &amp;c. they muſt forbeare their owne.</p>
            <p>But ſure it is a very hard thing, heere not to be deceaued. Nature flattereth it ſelfe, and blindeth, cuſtome hardeneth. Somewhat may we finde out our ſelues.</p>
            <p n="1">1 If we ſearch, and alwayes ſuſpect our ſelues.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If we are carefull to haue faithfull aduertiſers of vs, and will beleeue them. Sooner ſhall another eſpie our faults, then our ſelues.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Neglect not to marke euen the ſpeeches of enemies, for though they commonly neuer ſay all truth, yet they wil haue ſome occaſion or beginning from our ſelues: which is good to marke.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Where a man moſt liketh, take heede he be not there
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1866:124"/>moſt deceaued.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Againe others there are, which may be tearmed the ſinnes of the time and place, of the faſhion of the Country or world. Rom. 12, 2, Ephe. 2, 2.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe are Lot, Noah, Enoch, and infinite others, for that they were not caried away with the multitude, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned.</p>
            <p>Paule ſeemeth to ſet downe the ſinnes of this age of the world. 2, Tim: 3, 2, 3. So to liue in the Court forbearing, Court ſinnes is the duty, the like might be ſaid of infinite others.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Beſides, ſome are iudged leſſe then others, as ſwearing by faith and truth, playing at cards and tables, drinking, &amp;c. and yet all iniquity, euen theſe muſt be ſhunned. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt we walk circumſpectly, Ep. 5, 15, look 1, Cor. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>The leaſt wound in the heart and braine is deadly, ſmall leakes in ſhippes, or breaches in walls neglected, leeſe Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ſhippes, ſo is it for ſmall ſinnes, to the loſſe of the ſoule: yea, indifferent and warrantable things, if they be with ſcandall (that is with hinderance of others in they way to euerlaſting life) are greeuous ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Of this kinde is it to doe a little euill, that a greater good may follow vpon it. This is iniquity to be hated.</p>
            <p>Other kindes of iniquitie might haue beene named, but theſe ſufficiently ſhew, that wee all commit ſome one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of iniquity, whereby we are wretched, and had neede to ſeeke to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Hitherto of the obiect, the action or practiſe denied, is <hi>not doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doing</hi> doth ſignifie, any way of committing, or conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſinne, in our ſelues or others: which may be nine wayes, according to the verſes.</p>
            <p>Commaunder, conſenter, aduiſer, and ſoother.</p>
            <p>Abbettor, partaker, concealer, not hinderer.</p>
            <p>Not wraying full known ſinnes, theſe all each with other.</p>
            <p>Doe ſinne and iniquity what euer men cenſure.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the fift duty, now followeth the certainty
<pb facs="tcp:1866:125"/>and ſurenes of it, <hi>ſurely.</hi> This is moſt aſſured, for that the ſonnes of God cannot commit ſinne. Gods ſeed remaineth in them.</p>
            <p>And this the ſpirit ſetteth downe, not for that this truth can be doubted of in it ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 But for that the wicked are wont to cenſure the godly, and thinke moſt hardly of them for their ſlips, Gods ſpirit faith otherwiſe, vvhat euer wicked men iudge, theſe doe not commit iniquity.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Againe, for that the godly are much greeued with themſelues, and diſcouraged at their ſlips, whereas they are to be comforted, that God doth count this iniquity.</p>
            <p>Now then from all this of not committing, and doing of iniquity.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Learne we all what a great profeſſion a Chriſtian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, to forbeare all kinds and reſpects of ſinne.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Let vs diſcourage our ſelues what we can, from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of iniquity.</p>
            <p>That may we doe if we conſider: 1 It diſpleaſeth God, our ſo good a Father. 2 It was that which crucified Chriſt, our ſinnes, more then the hands of the Iewes: 3 It daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and rebateth, greeueth, and almoſt putteth out all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſpirit in vs. It dimmeth our knowledge, weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth our faith, ſtayeth our prayer, ſtoppeth our harts to the word, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4 A man ſhall haue much a-doe to riſe after any great ſinne: It coſt Dauid and Peter many ſower teares. 5 Sinne deſerueth all kinde of puniſhments now and heereafter: 6 And hath moſt ſharply beene puniſhed.</p>
            <p n="3">3 We ſhould what we could repent for former commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſinne, but endeuour to preuent ſuch as wee might be likely to fall into. It will be ſome helpe for vs this way. 1 Alwayes to thinke that the Angels behold vs, yea, that we doe nothing, but that God himſelfe vieweth and loketh vpon, 2 What we may, alwayes to giue our ſelues to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of religion and good company, ſinne dare not be there. 3 Remember thy Baptiſme, what thou diddeſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1866:125"/>there: to renounce the world, fleſh, deuill, and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to keepe Gods commaundements, and howe that God will not hold him guiltleſſe, that taketh his name in vaine. 4 Cenſure your ſelfe ſharply for ſmaller ſinnes, and thinke none little, ſo ſhall you be more able in time to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare all, thinketh Chriſoſtome. 5 Not onely ſo, but if you would forbeare ſinnes, be not too bold to aduenture vpon all indifferent things. 6 Reſiſt ſinnes in the beginning. 7 Bernard ſaith, that three wayes was he kept from ſinne: by taking away occaſion, hauing ſtrength to reſiſt tentation, and ſoundnes of affection. 8 Remember how ſhort and ſmall the pleaſure of ſinne is, and how long and greeuous the puniſhment is. 9 Often receaue the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the fift duty, the ſixt followeth: <hi>They walke in his wayes.</hi> And this all Interpreters reade not alike: ſome thus, they worke none iniquitie, who walke in his wayes, others they worke none iniquity, but walke in his wayes: it is moſt plaine and ſimple to reade it, without ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther relatiue or aduerſatiue particle, as is likewiſe in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew.</p>
            <p>This duty is ſet out affirmatiuely, after the former nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, not onely according to the manner of the Hebrew tongue, which ſetteth one oppoſite out by the other, but alſo to ſhew what kinde of ſanctification we ſhould haue, ſuch whereby we ſhould not onely forbeare ſinne, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low holines &amp; righteouſnes. Heathen people &amp; hypocrites abſtaine from many things, they doe not all which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded.</p>

            <p>The act of <hi>walking</hi> is metaphoricall and borowed, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth ſetting, and ordering of life: wherein, beſides the things we haue had before, are,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Ability to diſcerne the right way fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by-paths, &amp; to put a difference betweene Chriſtes voyce &amp; others. Ioh. 10, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>And this commeth by the bright Lampe of the word of God
<pb facs="tcp:1866:126"/>the word of God, the worke of it is any way profitable for mankinde, to ſoule or body, for this life or that which is to come. Take heede of others.</p>
            <p>The duties are well done, if firſt, 1 the party who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them be in Chriſt, that is, be iuſtified: 2 doe the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for conſcience to God, and in obedience to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements: 3 he call vpon God in the beginning of his worke, for gift ſufficient and enlarged, for a bleſsing of his worke, and thanks afterward: 4 his minde be alwayes free, euen in the worke, that he can lift vp himſelfe to God, &amp; neuer be vnfit for duties of godlines and charity. If ones works be not thus done, himſelfe can haue little comfort in them.</p>
            <p>In that the Prophet nameth theſe wayes, without deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which or how many, he would not haue vs doubt of any, but that a party who deſireth to be in bleſſed ſtate, ſhould endeuour in all. Some like ſome, few all. All who will be bleſſed, muſt runne on in all. <hi>Whatſoeuer the Lord commaundeth</hi> (ſaith the Iſraelites) <hi>that will we doe.</hi> Deut. 5, 27.</p>
            <p>Heere muſt be repeated againe the particle <hi>ſurely,</hi> in the ſence, and for the reaſons we had in the duty immediatly going before.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the ſixt duty by way of doctrine, ſome vſe would further be made of it: 1 to exhort vs to walke in theſe wayes: 2 to giue ſome helps to further vs in this wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: 3 to try whether we walke aright.</p>
            <p>We may eaſily, euen exhort our ſelues if we would, 1 but think, that theſe are the onely wayes, all other are by-paths, Pſal. 125, 5. Eſa, 30, 21.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That this is Gods commaundement, walke in the way. <hi>This is the way, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 And that once entred in, we ſhould finde them moſt ſweete, and eaſie, and that his (that is Gods) commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not greeuous. 4 Beſides, company will doe much, where Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and Prophets, and all holy men of all time haue taken this courſe: 5 So as in this
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1866:126"/>way they haue beene bleſſed: 6 and can but out of it be moſt wretched, and miſerable.</p>
            <p>Beſt helpes and meanes are, 1 the ſpirit of God, who will leade his into all truth, by whom we muſt walke. 2 Forget that which is behind, looke to that which is before. Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians, 3, 14. 3 Not to goe forward, argueth going back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>We ſhall try whether we walke aright: 1 If wee follow our guide, the ſpirit, and word. 2 If the godly who know this way, and walke in it, cannot finde vs ſwaruing. 3 If we draw neerer our home in heauen.</p>

            <p>The word <hi>precepts</hi> is in Hebrew <hi>Pickkude,</hi> ſignifying pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of vnderſtanding, which God hath ſet, and placed in the hart, and vnderſtanding teacheth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as Rabbi Dauid ſaith; and are for ſubſtance the ſame with law teſtimonie as before: neuertheleſſe, ſince it pleaſeth the ſpirit of God to vſe ſome ſundry names for one thing, it muſt needes be with ſome difference. I iudge therefore that the word of God heere is called by this name, in regard of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1866:127"/>Gods ſeruants haue of it, as of the which any of them cannot altogether be ignorant. They are therefore that which Iames calleth the word engraffed. 1, 21, or ſpringing in or among you.</p>
            <p>God is wont to ſow it, and make it grow into the harts of his ſeruants.</p>
            <p>Then is it thus engraffed, when it is mingled with faith, Heb. 4, 2. which is: 1 when one beleeueth it to be true: 2 and beleeueth that it belongeth vnto him.</p>
            <p>Heere therefore doth GOD forbid to doe any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſhining truth of his word in our hearts, nay hee commaundeth to doe all things there-after.</p>
            <p>For ſuch are theſe precepts knowne, vnderſtoode, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be the truth of GOD. For better vnderſtanding whereof know that,</p>
            <p>It is one thing to ſinne, ſo as that ones conſcience may accuſe him, and another thing to ſinne againſt a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>Who ſo euer ſinneth at one time or other, his conſcience wil accuſe him. But euery one that ſinneth, doth not ſinne againſt his conſcience.</p>
            <p>To ſinne againſt ones conſcience is, after knowledge of the will of God had, and ſhining in the hart, to doe againſt it. Which God doth heere forbid, and requireth that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the knowledge of Gods precepts wee ſhould doe.</p>
            <p>True it is that ſometimes Gods children, euen ſinne (which is a fearefull thing) againſt their owne conſciences, which they neuer ſhould doe: for who ſo euer knoweth, and doeth not, to him it is ſinne. Yea, if he be falſly in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience enformed, it is better to doe with, then againſt his conſcience. Indeede the ſafeſt way is rightly to inſtruct the conſcience.</p>
            <p>Now then, whereas the ſeruants of God haue the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods commaundements, &amp; are ſomtimes drawne to doe againſt their knowledge, God chargeth they ſhould not ſo doe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:128"/>
            <p> Leaſt wee ſhould doubt whether Gods children are brought ſometimes to doe againſt their knowledge, call to minde Adam, who could not be ignorant, Dauid, Peter, and ſuch other.</p>
            <p>Indeede there is a difference Gods children thus ſinning, and the world, and wicked: 1 Gods children effectually called, haue alwayes a ſetled purpoſe, and endeuour not to ſinne: ſo haue not the reprobate, nay they purpoſe to ſinne.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The reprobate and wicked deſire to haue the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, which they haue ſhining in their harts, put out, the elect deſire, to haue it more cleare &amp; bright.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The elect in their ſinning at the inſtant of it, haue their knowledge which they haue of the will of God, obſcured that they cannot ſee. Vehemencie of tentation raiſeth ſuch a cloude, as hideth the light of vnderſtanding, ſo did the wine intoxicate Noah and Lot, Dauid likewiſe and Peter were thus beguiled, that though before they knew, yet now tentation made them forget God: the wicked in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of their ſinnes, ſee, and know they ſhould doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The elect, when ſo euer any knowledge of God ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in them, if they ſinne, it is with great ſtrife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the fleſh and the ſpirit, as we ſee in Paule, Rom. 7, and Gal. 5, 17, the reprobate are not ſo, the ſtrong man holdeth them.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The elect are more greeued for theſe ſinnes then any other, they are moſt perplexed for them, and deſire to riſe out of them by renuing repentance, &amp;c, ſo doe not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, but reſt, and ſometimes glory in them.</p>
            <p>This ſeemeth to be the meaning of the words, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions are,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Neuer ſhall we fully profit by the word, till it be roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ingraffed in vs.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In any caſe let vs take heed, that we neuer ſinne againſt our conſciences: becauſe 1 nothing will ſo wound the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience afterward as this. 2 It is the high way to ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1866:128"/>the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Now to helpe vs this way, it will be good to.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Keepe as bright as wee can alwayes in our hearts, the light of the word of God ſhining.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Reſiſt the beginnings of tentations to ſinne, elſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, and multiplying, they will grow too ſtrong. Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are like to the cloude that appeared to Elias ſeruant, little or nothing at the firſt, and preſently it ouer-ſpread the whole skie. Thoughts riſe in the head, &amp; ſuddainly drowne the hart.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Take heede of ſolitarines: there would the deuil haue vs alone hand to hand. Good company will keepe our knowledge the brighter, and helpe vs with counſaile, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, prayers, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4 In any caſe to take heede of the cuſtome of ſinne, that will take away the feeling, and iudgement of ſinne.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the obiect, the act followeth in the word <hi>keeping,</hi> whereof before in the ſecond verſe. The word in Hebrew is diuers with that verſe, 2, of keeping, and beſides all that it did ſignifie there, doth further heere imply vnto vs,</p>
            <p n="1">1 To obſerue, that is heedfully to marke, and bend ones minde vnto, ſo Eli marked Hanna. 1, Sam, 1, 12.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To keepe, or preſerue the thing ſafe, that it be not the worſe: ſo Dauid would be kept as the apple of Gods eye: Pſal. 17, 8. ſo Adam ſhould keepe the garden, Gen. 2, 15, ſo Cain denieth to be his brothers keeper, Gen, 4, 9.</p>
            <p n="3">3 So to keepe as the thing be not taken away, Pſal. 119, 44.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That it may be for vſe to our ſelues and others. Mala. 2, 7, for ſo were the prieſts lips to preſerue knowledge.</p>
            <p>So that we ſee what our duties are.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To giue dilligent heede to the word of God, and the rather: 1 for that according to it, ſhould all our motions and practiſes be framed: 2 and is very hard in it ſelfe: ſo as it is needfull, that euen the leaſt things ſhould be heeded, hitherto belongeth that Iames, 1, 25. looking into the law.</p>

            <p n="3">3 Alwayes ſuch deſires are commendable, when they are with purpoſe and practiſe.</p>

            <p n="2">2 And if Dauids wayes neede redreſſing, what ſhall any mans elſe doe?</p>
            <p>This is the thing, the quality followeth, in the word <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Directing,</hi> is of the word <hi>Kun</hi> in Hebrew, which among other things ſignifieth two: 1 Straitnes. 2 Steadines.</p>
            <p>Straitnes is when euery duty is leuell with the word of God, nothing ſwaruing there-from. Euery mans wayes by nature are crooked: 2 euen the beſt haue ſomewhat which may be amended: 3 they alwayes doe feare themſelues, leaſt euery duty might be better.</p>
            <p>Steadines is conſtancie, that is, continuance in ſtraitnes: and without this, all things are nothing. For what booteth it to haue ſomething, and not alwayes?</p>
            <p>Now this is the more to be thought of, for that Gods children are alwayes ſubiect to errors and ſlips.</p>
            <p>And if they would be conſtant: 1 they had neede looke to their foundation and roote, that it be deepely ſet.</p>
            <p n="2">2 They muſt often try, and examine themſelues.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It will be beſt for them, often to exorciſe themſelues in all godly duties.</p>
            <p>The meane or ſubordinate end is as we haue ſeene, now followeth the vtmoſt end, to <hi>keepe thy ſtatutes.</hi>

            <p>By this we may ſee, that Gods children deſire to doe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for duties ſake, in that Dauid deſireth his wayes to be directed to keepe Gods ſtatutes.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the act, the obiect remaineth, <hi>ſtatutes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Statutes</hi> for meaning and intent, are the ſame with <hi>law, testimonie,</hi> &amp;c. as before: but is more ſpecially, and ofteneſt vſed, for religious and holy ceremonies ordained by God, in the Leuiticall miniſtery and ſeruice. Theſe were for the worſhip of God, for outward ſhew, baſe, and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that many.</p>
            <p>Let vs all therefore learne by Dauids example: 1 to be more carefull to keepe Gods ordinances, then mens ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, or then to ordaine new, which are beſide the word.</p>
            <p>Now the ordinances and rites of God ordained, are the rites and ceremonies in the Sacraments, ſo as that the pure adminiſtration in them is to be kept.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And ſince that God hath commaunded them, nothing is to be thought, neither too much, nor too little.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Yea, where as Dauid deſireth to keepe theſe ſtatutes, he meaneth that he would not reſt in the deede done, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out motions and changes in the hart: for all rites kept are ſuperfluous, without the inward and ſpirituall worſhip: wherefore alwayes in ceremonies looke for the ſubſtance, which is Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And that wiſhing that hee might keepe the outward ordinances, he ſheweth the inward ſpirituall worſhip is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be performed.</p>

            <p>Many can better forbeare faults, then doe good duties, and yet both are Gods commaundements.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Some will keepe Gods commaundements in one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and neglect them in another, many in proſperity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Goſpell, ſhrinke from it in the croſſe: ſome in the croſſe will be meeke, will pray, &amp;c. they are not ſo in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity.</p>
            <p>He who keepeth Gods commaundements, wil endeuour in them in one eſtate, as well as in another, elſe doth not he keepe all Gods commaundements.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the time of this <hi>respecting all Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, when:</hi> which vnleſſe it were to ſpeciall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe had not beene ſet downe. This is diuers times in this Pſalm, euen in the next verſe, and verſe 32, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Heere is no limitation or ſetting downe of this time, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is that ſometime it was, though not a-like alwayes, neither can be in any. It is hard to tell the particular times when Dauid had reſpect: yet wee may be ſure he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: 1 When God ſtirred vp his heart to be ſet heere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, which was in his priuate exorciſe of reading, &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and meditating, or publique.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It was not alwayes, at leaſt not in the ſame tenour and meaſure. Sometimes Dauid ſinned, and did not reſpect Gods commaundements.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Though it were not alwayes, the Prophet is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to imply ſo much, that others might take knowledge thereof. We gather then, that,</p>

            <p n="2">2 If we would reſpect them, we muſt ſeeke to God, and continually vſe the meanes.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It is cleere that Dauid conſidered how he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, calling himſelfe home to a reckoning, as euery one ſhould doe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The Saints of God how holy ſo euer, will confeſſe their wants and defaults.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the cauſe or occaſion, now followeth the euent, <hi>then ſhall I not be confounded.</hi>

            <p>The thing, <hi>I ſhall not be confounded:</hi> the time <hi>then.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Confuſion commeth of a Latine word, which though it may ſignifie ſuch a mixture of things together, that one cannot diſcerne betweene them, yet heere the Hebrew whereof this commeth, will not beare it, but ſignifieth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to be aſhamed.</p>
            <p>Shame is taken 1 properly. For the affection vſually ſo called, and appeareth in the countenance. 2 Vnproperly. When it is referred to the ſoule and conſcience, as very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, ſhame and confuſion is ſo taken in the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>Being confounded is taken in the ſecond ſence, to wit, vnproperly in this place, for exceſsiue ſhame of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before God and man. Which is, when a man is as much caſt downe in conſcience before God, as the moſt ſhame faced man is or can be in countenance before any, yea and more.</p>
            <p>Now this ſhame or confuſion may be conſidered, firſtly, from a cauſe of it: which is to miſſe, or be diſappointed, for then ſhal a man haue bodily ſhame, if he miſſe of his known particular deſignment, or when ſo euer (being of any good nature) he doeth amiſſe, ſo euen for the conſcience, if a ſinne be committed, or we miſſe of our deſires to God, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
<pb facs="tcp:1866:131"/>are caſt downe. So as that Dauid heere meaneth: that,</p>
            <p>He ſhall haue no cauſe of ſhame.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Cauſe of ſhame is wittingly committing of any ſinne, true it is that all ſinne will make aſhamed, but this moſt. Therefore Dauid will auoide ſinne, as euery one ſhould doe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Another cauſe of ſhame is miſsing our deſires, ſo ſhall not Dauid, God will heare his prayers, as all other of his children. Pſal. 25, 2, 3. Thus are the wicked aſhamed, that is diſappointed of their hope. Marke the fruite of godly prayers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from the effects, for as naturall or worldly ſhame hath many and great effects, ſo much more hath the ſhame of conſcience, as being part of the torment of hell.</p>
            <p n="1">1 As in worldly ſhame, one and a firſt work is to change the minde, ſo ſhame of conſcience, will make it change the minde and iudgement: for ſeeing it ſelfe to haue done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, it muſt needes repent, and that much blaming and accuſing it ſelfe. So ſhall not Dauid neede to feare that he ſhall doe: for endeuouring to keepe Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he ſhall not neede to change his minde, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and encreaſe. So Abigael telleth Dauid, that when God ſhall haue giuen him the Kingdome, that it ſhal be no griefe vnto him, nor offence of minde, that hee hath not ſhed blood cauſeleſſe. 1, Sam. 25, 31, ſhe meaneth this work of the conſcience.</p>
            <p>So ſhall Dauid, and all other Gods ſeruants, be free from greatly blaming themſelues, which what a torment it is, we cannot be ignorant: looke Prouerb. 5, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>Indeede repentance is a continuall practiſe of all, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery the children of GOD: ſo as that the former may be doubted of.</p>
            <p>Aun. Repentance may be conſidered, as
<list>
                  <item>beginning.</item>
                  <item>encreaſing.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Beginning, is at the firſt turne &amp; change of man to God,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1866:131"/>after which a man is preſerued, from the wilfull committing of groſſe ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Encreaſing repentance is, groweth in the former, when liuing out of groſſe ſinnes, and being truly turned to God, we labour to draw neerer and neerer vnto him: thus with encreaſing repentance we muſt alwayes change &amp; repent, not with the firſt and beginning repentance, which we can not but haue, if we regard Gods commaundements.</p>
            <p n="2">2 As worldly ſhame hath feare to come in preſence, ſo is it in ſhame of the conſcience, wicked men dare not come in the preſence of God: Adam and Eue hid themſelues, Cain fled from the preſence of God.</p>
            <p>Dauid, and other Gods children ſhall not thus be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Naturall ſhame maketh one alwayes doubt, whether duties doe pleaſe, it rather thinketh they diſpleaſe: ſo doth feare and ſhame of conſcience driue a man to thinke, that God doth not care for any thing that he doeth. So was it with Cain, as in deede he ſaw he did not pleaſe God. Gen. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>From this Dauid, and thoſe who reſpect Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, are free.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, from the property, bodily, or worldly ſhame, is with as great vnquietnes as poſſibly may be. It cannot be otherwiſe with ſhame and confuſion of the conſcience: from this likewiſe Dauid &amp; other Gods children are free.</p>
            <p>This which the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>I ſhould not be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> is a kinde of ſpeech, in which by the leſſe, the more and greater is ſet downe, ſo Pſal. 51, 17. <hi>Thou doest not despiſe,</hi> for thou doeſt very well like, and 1, Cor, 11, 22. <hi>I praiſe you not,</hi> that is, I much diſpraiſe and blame you: ſo Heb. 13, 17. <hi>Will be not profitable for you,</hi> that is, will be very hurtfull: ſo is it heere, <hi>I ſhall not be confounded,</hi> that is, I ſhall haue great boldnes and comfort. All which doth ariſe from a cleare
<pb facs="tcp:1866:132"/>and good conſcience, which is a continuall feaſt, Prouerb. 1, 5, 15, ſo that the thing the Prophet meaneth, that he hath a good conſcience, and the fruite thereof.</p>
            <p>And firſt for a good conſcience: 1 what it is: 2 how it is wrought: 3 what be the properties of it.</p>
            <p>Before we can know a good conſcience, know what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is, which well we may doe by the parts of it.</p>
            <p>The firſt is a knowledge of truth and falſhoode, good, and bad. Therfore is it called conſcience, that is with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and that not onely in generall rules, but in ſpeciall and particular, wherein conſcience eſpecially appeareth: generall rules are in the <hi>Syntereſis,</hi> particular knowledge, and remembrance in the <hi>Syneideſis</hi> or conſcience.</p>
            <p>The ſecond a diligent marking and recording, as euery particular thing is beleeued, or not beleeued, done, or not done, thought or not thought, according to knowledge.</p>
            <p>The third, is affection riſing after knowledge and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and by things done, thought, beleeued, ſpoken, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to knowledge ariſeth ioy, hope, and comfort, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, greefe, feare, and trouble.</p>
            <p>Good conſcience is, when the knowledge is true, full, and ſound, when it letteth not ſlip any particular, but cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all to count, and findeth them rightly according to knowledge performed, where-vpon ariſeth continuall ioy, quiet, comfort.</p>
            <p>Good conſcience is wrought, as all other graces of Gods ſpirit. No mans conſcience is good by nature: other meanes therefore are needefull.</p>
            <p n="1">1 One is, ſound faith of iuſtification, when the party ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Chriſtes righteouſnes imputed by God himſelfe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth it by faith, to the forgiuenes of all his ſinnes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting of righteouſnes: ſo as that the conſcience is clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and quieted in regard of all things paſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Sanctification, which ariſing and liuing in faith, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth with faith, and preſerueth good conſcience for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: without theſe neuer good conſcience.</p>
            <p>Now the properties of good conſcience are many.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:1866:132"/> 1 Truly and fully alwayes to admoniſh, according to the light of the word of God, ſhining in the hart.</p>

            <p n="3">3 To giue a good hope in all things.</p>
            <p n="4">4 To make one leade an vnblameable life.</p>
            <p>Thus much for good conſcience, the fruite followeth, which is wonderous great euery way: and hath all things contrary to confuſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It maketh one neuer to change his generall reſolution.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It delighteth to come into the preſence of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Is perſwaded that God liketh it.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Hath courage in all good duties.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Truſt in the fauour of God. 6 Hath peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. 7 Ioy in the ſpirit. 8 Looking for all good things from God. 9 Patience in the croſſe.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the thing, now followeth the time <hi>then,</hi> to wit, when I ſhall haue reſpect, as if he ſhould ſay, vnleſſe I haue reſpect, &amp;c, I ſhall be confounded.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Que. Who can reſpect all, and euery of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God?</p>
            <p>Aun. None: and therfore all haue great cauſe of ſhame.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And ſeeing that all Gods commaundements muſt be reſpected, euen the leaſt are to be regarded, not neglected.</p>
            <p n="3">3 No meruaile therefore if none can at any time be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, but ſhall finde himſelfe toſſed betweene feare and hope, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And why, ſince there is ſuch good conſequence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Gods commandements, doe not we all moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully regard them?</p>
            <p>Thus much for the third particular, in the Prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, now followeth the fourth, verſe, 7,

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1866:133"/>eſpecially in ſuch neceſſary things as he giueth vs for our being and well being.</p>
            <p>Acknowledging, is our profeſſion, that this excellencie is in God.</p>
            <p>Now this our profeſſion muſt be: 1 open, ſo as it may be knowne: 2 franke &amp; cheerefull, not conſtrained: 3 with harmonie of mouth, hart, and life.</p>
            <p>Who would not performe this duty: 1 pleaſing God: 2 due from himſelfe?</p>
            <p>Thus much for the action, now followeth the obiect, <hi>thee,</hi> ô <hi>Iehoua,</hi> whom indeede we are alone to praiſe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely worthy.</p>
            <p n="1">1 God being to be prayſed, is to be conſidered with meanes of any thing, or without meanes. Many will praiſe God, and acknowledge his hand, when they ſee him work without meanes, becauſe then they ſee nothing, whereto they can aſcribe that worke but onely to God, and yet it is onely God who giueth meanes, renueth them, and bleſſeth them, ſo as in the middeſt of all meanes muſt we lift vp our hart to God, and praiſe him, and neuer ſacrifice vnto our net.</p>
            <p n="2">2 God may be conſidered towards our ſelues or others. Many wil praiſe God for themſelues: few for others, and yet ſo muſt they doe, and euen for their enemies: ſo farre muſt wee all be from enuying or leſſening any of Gods works.</p>
            <p n="3">3 God giueth proſperity aduerſity. Some feeling the ſweetnes of proſperity, can acknowledge Gods goodnes. Where is any that praiſeth God for aduerſity? And yet ſo muſt we all doe, and not onely that, but reioyce therein. Rom. 5, 3.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Then ſhal a man be the fitter to praiſe God for aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, when he hath ſome while beene vnder: neuer at the firſt will or can a man vſually thank for it. 2 When by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene vnder it hee hath gotten ſome good by it, as knowledge of Gods prouidence, iuſtice, power, perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods goodnes, encreaſe of faith, exorciſe of patience,
<pb facs="tcp:1866:134"/>meekenes, prayer, &amp;c. elſe will our prayſing for it be but cold. And therefore all mens ſpeeches, who ſay, they thank God for afflictions, are not euer true.</p>
            <p>Hitherto of the thing, now followeth the manner, <hi>With an vpright hart:</hi> ſo as it muſt be with the <hi>hart,</hi> and that <hi>vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right:</hi> ſo as heere is, 1 ſubiect. 2 Adiunct.</p>
            <p>The ſubiect, is <hi>hart,</hi> put heere for the ſoule, becauſe that it is as it were the chaire of eſtate of the ſoule, wherein it moſt ſheweth it ſelfe in preſence.</p>
            <p>The ſoule is put for the whole man, where the ſoule is, firſt affection, then all parts and powers of ſoule and body. This doth the Prophet name,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe God chiefely reſpecteth the hart: 2 And the moſt part of men doe commonly neglect it.</p>
            <p>God reſpecteth it: 1 As to be the firſt, ſo as without this all is nothing. 2 With this all other follow: 3 In this is a ſweet feeling of Gods infinite goodnes towards vs: 4 And as in the bodily hart there is continuall beating, ſo is there in this a renuing, and continuall frequentation of all godly duties.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Wherefore euery one who praiſeth God, muſt doe it from his hart, that is, his ſoule, that is, 1 from his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as being ſetled that he ought ſo to doe: 2 from his wil and affections, as delighting therein.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Who ſo euer (ſaith he) praiſeth God with his hart, muſt doe it with his whole man, elſe his praiſe is no praiſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3 No praiſing of God without feeling. 4 All prayſing of God continued alwayes renued.</p>
            <p>The adiunct followeth <hi>vpright,</hi> for declaring whereof, it ſhall be good to conſider: 1 What it is: 2 Howe it is wrought and gotten: 3 How it may be tried: 4 How it may be kept and preſerued.</p>
            <p>What it is, may ſomewhat appeare by the very name it ſelfe, eſpecially in the Hebrew tongue, where word for word it is thus, <hi>with vprightnes of hart,</hi> and is indeed in effect that our tranſlation hath with an vpright hart, ſaue that it ſignifieth it in great meaſure and perfection: ſo doth the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1866:134"/>Hebrew tongue, vſe Nowne Subſtantiues for Adiectiues, very ſignificantly. Now this vprightnes, though it be in Engliſh the ſame word, with that in the 1 ver. of this Pſalm, yet is not ſo in the Hebrew, but ſomewhat more generall, and ſignifieth right or ſtraite. Vpright is but one reſpect of right or ſtrait, right hath all reſpects in it vpward, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, on both ſides, &amp;c. It is therefore heere a word vſed vnproperly, contrary to that which is wrethen or crooked: and for meaning and intent, ſeemeth to be the ſame with cleane hart, Pſal. 51, 12. ſignifying ſuch a diſpoſition in the ſoule and whole man, as hath nothing iuſtly greatly to be blamed, humaine frailty onely excepted.</p>
            <p>It is termed right: 1 Becauſe it is according to the right ſtatutes of Iehoua, Pſal. 19, 9. 2 And is after the firſt and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall ſtraitnes which was in man, according to Gods i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, from the which men ſwaruing are called, Luke, 9, 41, a <hi>crooked generation,</hi> and Philip. 2, 15, <hi>crooked Nations.</hi> And practiſes of ſuch parties are phraſed, Pſal. 125, 5, <hi>crooked wayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet this muſt be remembred to be vnderſtoode euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically, as before <hi>whole hart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heere-vpon S. Auguſtine ſaith that, <hi>that man hath a ſtrait or right hart, who willeth all things which God will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this ſort can be no hart not regenerate and borne a new, all naturall harts are crooked. The Poet could call them <hi>crooked mindes.</hi> But for the full knowledge what this is, three things are neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="1">1 True, ſound, and full ſauing inſtruction and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſo as that where this is not, no ſtraitnes or rightnes of hart can be. This knowledge muſt be: 1 In the neceſſary grounds of ſaluation, the Trinitie, Chriſt, faith, iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſanctification: 2 In this particular duty of prayſing God. So as that euery one muſt know that God is to be praiſed: 2 Fitly take the occaſion whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is giuen: 3 Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie performe the duty of praiſe: as we may reade before.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Sincerity, that there be counterfetting, no deceauing.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Continuall conformity to the word of God, or firſt
<pb facs="tcp:1866:135"/>ſtraitnes of Gods image, wherein man was created. All which are ſo neceſſary, as that to the parties endued heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, onely God is pleaſed. Pſalm, 73, 1, Math. 5, 8. Pſalm, 24, 4.</p>
            <p>This is wrought and gotten as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graces of ſaluation, that is, by
<list>
                  <item>iuſtification.</item>
                  <item>ſanctification.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>By iuſtification, when the ſinnes of our naturall or vſuall crookednes, for Chriſtes righteouſnes being forgiuen, his ſtraitnes &amp; vprightnes is imputed to vs by God the Father, ſealed to vs by the holy Ghoſt, who likewiſe worketh faith in vs, whereby we apply it to our ſelues.</p>
            <p>By ſanctification, when receauing the powerfull ſpirit of ſanctification we are renued, to thinke, doe, ſay, and euery way practiſe right things, otherwiſe there can be no true ſtraitnes in vs.</p>
            <p>This may we trie whether it be in our ſelues, (it is hard to iudge of others.) 1, By the cauſes of it, &amp; vſe of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1 If the party who thinketh he hath it, haue from the firſt occaſion offered, vſed the meanes thereof (to wit the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word) in ſimplicity and continuance, it is the more likely to be preſent, otherwiſe not.</p>
            <p>Seaſons of things not neglected preuaile much: twigges may be bowed in time, fleſh will ſometimes take ſalt: one may come too late to both of theſe. Againe, formall vſe onely of the former is neuer ſufficient. It pearceth not to the hart, where this muſt be.</p>
            <p n="2">2, By the fruites. One whereof, is perceauing of a mans owne crookednes. Alwayes the more ſtraitnes, the more perceauing of crookednes. For as in the body, the ſicknes is moſt dangerous, when the diſtemperature is generall that no part can perceaue it, and when all things are in quiet by reaſon of ſtrong hold, the captiuity is the greater: ſo no perceauing of crookednes little or no ſtraitnes at all. With this is alwayes ioyned patience of reprehenſions, from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of crookednes, worthy to be found fault with.</p>
            <p>Another is delighting in ſtraite things, as the word of God, godly company. Like liketh like. Right men loue
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1866:135"/>right ſpeeches, actions.</p>
            <p>Heere is neuer feare of too much preciſenes, a thing can neuer be too right and ſtraite. Right lines, are the onely within their points.</p>
            <p>A third is plainenes and opennes. Crooked legges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light not to ſhew themſelues. Cloſe men, in duties of the open worſhip of God, and their calling may alwayes be ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>A fourth, willingnes to offer it ſelfe at any time to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is a token when Rahel was loath to be raiſed and ſearched that ſhe had ſtollen and hidden: ſo crooked harts are loath to come to the rule and ſquare.</p>
            <p>This is kept and preſerued, by the continuance in thoſe things whereby it firſt is wrought, firſt muſt iuſtification be had and kept, then ſanctification continually renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Heereto may ſomewhat helpe meditation, and ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the heart, that as ſoone as any crookednes appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, it may be made ſtraite, prayer, Sacraments, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>All this hath beene touching the fact of praiſing God, now followeth the publiſhing of it, in that he ſaith, <hi>he will praiſe:</hi> thus doth Dauid very often.</p>
            <p>Queſt. Could not Dauid haue done this, and neuer been acknowne of it?</p>
            <p>Aun. In ſome caſe Dauid might haue concealed this duty, ſo might Daniel, 6, Dan: but heere he ought not to be willing ſo to doe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 This is one vſe of the knowne examples in good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they ſhew that it is not impoſsible (as ſome dreame) to performe them.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Dauid is a publique teacher of the Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt teach in word and deede.</p>
            <p n="3">3 He is a Prince, and muſt giue the firſt on ſet: others will ſooner imitate.</p>
            <p n="4">4 He would ſhew that men muſt not be aſhamed (for all mens cenſures) of their good deedes. Well ſaith Ariſtotle, he who ſetteth out his good duties too much, and concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb facs="tcp:1866:136"/>them too much, both are proud.</p>
            <p n="5">5 He would heereby tie himſelfe to the more conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable performance of this practiſe, for hauing engaged him ſelfe by ſolemne profeſſion, it were the greater ſhame for him to ſtart back. All theſe reſpects are to preuaile with vs in like caſes.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the duty <hi>of prayſing God, &amp;c.</hi> Now follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the cauſe, <hi>When I ſhall learne, &amp;c.</hi> Whereof we may conſider as it is in it ſelfe, and as it hath vſe in this place. Conſidering of it in it ſelfe, we may ſunder the

            <p>A teacher, is one offering meanes of profiting: and is principall

            </p>
            <p>A leſſe principall teacher is, whereof there is ſome neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, and yet he is not ſufficient. This teacher is 1 mute, Which maketh no ſound as bookes, other creatures. 2 Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. Who maketh a ſound, as teachers, commonly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, in Church, Schoole, family.</p>
            <p>More principall is he who is neceſſary and ſufficient, ſo onely is the holy ſpirit, who fully and ſufficiently teacheth all. His chaire is in heauen, his formes are heere vppon earth.</p>
            <p>The intent of the teacher is: 1, That the learner ſhould hearken and giue heede to the Maiſter and teacher. So as that reading, hearing, and the breathing of the holy Ghoſt, are neceſſary, according to our diuers teachers.</p>
            <p n="2">2, That the learner vnderſtand: without this all is in vaine, yet is it hard in matters of diuinitie. Therefore had they neede: 1 plainly to be deliuered: 2 often to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated: 3 diuers times to be queſtioned, and conferred of.</p>
            <p n="3">3, That he lay vp for neceſſary vſes, in and according to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1866:136"/>his kinde of learning.</p>
            <p>Neceſſary vſes in diuinitie are: 1 to know doctrine of ſaluation: 2 to haue ſauing faith: 3 to amend and turne our liues: 4 to order euery particular practiſe of life.</p>
            <p n="4">4, Alwayes to be profiting and going forward, that he may riſe from one forme to another.</p>
            <p>All this is to learne.</p>
            <p>Dauid doth not ſay, that he hath learned, or will learne, had he not, or would he not therefore learne? yes he had, and would.</p>
            <p>Againe it may be thought that Dauid now had not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: but ſure it is that he had, but hee doth not much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it, in labouring for that which he wanteth, he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing of that which he hath.</p>
            <p>Now let vs all by Dauids example, learne Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iudgements, which we had neede the more to thinke: becauſe, 1 that all excellent things (ſuch is this) are very hard: 2 we haue no helps of nature to this, as to other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: 3 nor take ſo much time for it: 4 Beſides, many thinke that little of this learning is ſufficient: 5 ſurely it is of meruailous vſe.</p>
            <p>Somwhat may we iudge of our profiting in this learning. 1 If wee can diſcerne betweene good and bad, truth and falſhood, ſauing doctrine and others, and beſt like of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing learning. 2 If we learne to like and practiſe, not only to ſpeake and know. 3 If we like, and be able to teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p n="4">4 If when our Maiſter, leſſe principall, be ſometime ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we can take out a leſſon by our ſelues, by meditating, praying, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">5 If our profiting be according to the time, and meanes, and excellent teachers.</p>
            <p>Hitherto the endeuour of learning, the obiect followeth. <hi>The iudgements of thy righteouſnes.</hi> Wherein is declared the kinde of thing <hi>iudgements,</hi> the ſubiect of it <hi>thine,</hi> &amp; the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, <hi>of righteouſnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The kinde of thing is, <hi>iudgements.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:137"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Iudgements</hi> are one of the ten names, whereby the word of God is called in this Pſalm, &amp; may better be vnderſtood, if we aright know what it is to iudge.</p>
            <p>To iudge properly, is to determine or giue ſentence, and by a manner of ſpeech, where the part is put for the whole, it is to rule, order, or gouerne. So God is called the Iudge of all the world. Gen. 18, 15, and Iohn, 5, 22. <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath committed all iudgement,</hi> that is, regiment, <hi>to his ſonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all Gods iudging is infinitely wiſe, as conſtant.</p>
            <p>God iudgeth ſometimes by his works, as Eſa, 26, 8. Ier. 1, 16, 1, Cor. 11, 29. where that which is tranſlated <hi>condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is better <hi>iudgement,</hi> that is, puniſhment.</p>
            <p>And theſe works are toward ones ſelfe or ſome other, of mercy or iuſtice, and muſt not be neglected. Wee muſt know that,</p>
            <p n="1">1 They are all of God: 2 Marke of what kinde they are, fauours, or puniſhments. 3 Get ſomewhat out of them to inſtruct vs in the knowledge or worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>But yet theſe kinds of iudgements are not heere meant. For beſides, God iudgeth by his word, 1, Cor. 14, 24, he is iudged of all, the word wherein they are exerciſed iudgeth him: ſo Ezech. 20, 4.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the iudgements vnderſtood, which are many, ſome of greater, other of leſſe importance, as the branches and clauſes of the word of God are.</p>
            <p>Theſe one is ſaid to learne: 1 when hee well vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them: 2 getteth that fruit by them which God would he ſhould: 3 and in more particular vſeth them, as a rule to frame euery ſpeciall office, and practiſe of life by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſubiect or party</hi> whoſe they are, is God, of whom ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times we haue ſpoken before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The quality</hi> remaineth: It may be doubted, to what the word <hi>righteouſnes</hi> may be referred, for the Hebrew is, as that it may be thus, <hi>of thy righteouſnes,</hi> that is, of thee who art righteous, as Pſalm. 15, 1, in the mountaine of thy holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, of thee who art holy: ſo Pſal. 51, 11. <hi>Take not thy holy
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1866:137"/>ſpirit from me,</hi> that is, the ſpirit of thee who art holy.</p>
            <p>Or thus, <hi>of thy righteouſnes,</hi> that is, which are very iuſt, for in the Hebrew tongue ſubſtantiues are put for adiectiues, and then they ſignifie ſome fulnes and perfection.</p>
            <p>Both ſences are true, and may be taken heere, for God himſelfe is righteous, and his word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Righteous</hi> is that which giueth euery thing the owne.</p>
            <p>Queſt. How then is Gods word righteous, to promiſe vs fauour who are ſinners, can it be ours, or due vnto vs?</p>
            <p>Aun. Certaine it is that it is ours, not by our owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, but, 1 by Gods promiſe: 2 And be Chriſtes deſert, ſo as God ſhould not be righteous, if he ſhould not giue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to the faithfull and repentant, hauing promiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his ſonne deſerued it.</p>
            <p>Gods iudgements are termed iuſt, 1 being Gods, who is iuſt: 2 endeuouring to draw vs to iuſtice.</p>
            <p>Let none therefore murmure at any word or worke of God, and euery one labour to be the more righteous by them.</p>
            <p>Hitherto haue wee conſidered the cauſe alone by it ſelfe, now it followeth ioyned with the effect. <hi>When I ſhal learne, then, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 He ſheweth that there can be no ſufficient prayſing of God, without learning of his iudgements.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That he would refer all his knowledge to the prayſing of God.</p>
            <p>Thus much for Dauids fourth particular practiſe and duty the fift followeth in the beginning of the eighth verſe, <hi>I will keepe thy ſtatutes.</hi>

            <pb facs="tcp:1866:138"/>
            <p> Queſt. Dauid profeſſeth as though he had ſome ability in himſelfe, is it ſo, or whence was it?</p>
            <p>Aun. All that Dauid had was from God. An vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man can doe nothing, a regenerate man by Chriſt, or Gods grace in him can doe.</p>
            <p>Queſt. When Iames ſaith, 4, 15, that we ought to ſay if the Lord will. &amp;c, whether doth Dauid offend, leauing it out?</p>
            <p>Aun. Dauid, though he leaue it out in word, yet doth he not ſo in hart: ſo muſt we, and ſinne not.</p>
            <p>Compare this profeſſion with that wiſh aboue, verſe, 5, <hi>O that my wayes were directed to keepe thy ſtatutes,</hi> that which he there prayeth for, heere he obtaineth.</p>
            <p>Endeuour to profit is neuer vnfruitfull. So end many Pſalmes in hope and ioy, beginning with feare &amp; griefe.</p>
            <p>Marke that Dauid ſpeaking thus boldly, fore-caſteth the worſt which might hinder, ſo muſt euery one doe.</p>

            <p>Speciall is a gift of ſaluation, and that in the elect, as faith, hope, and charity.</p>
            <p>Gods forſaking of a man in theſe is vnderſtood: for ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God taketh euen theſe away, but we muſt remember that,</p>
            <p n="1">1 He neuer taketh them away fully, ſome braunches or ſparkles of them remaine, as the roote of a tree.</p>
            <p n="2">2 He neuer taketh them away finally, if he take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, he giueth them againe.</p>
            <p>Now God ſo taketh theſe away, as that ſometime,</p>
            <p n="1">1 He taketh away the thing it ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 He taketh the knowledge or feeling of the thing to be preſent.</p>
            <p n="3">3 He taketh away the worke and fruite of the thing: this is Gods forſaking.</p>

            <p>Sometimes the couenant of works is propounded after the fall, that it might conuince of ſinne, and prepare to the other couenant, which is of faith.</p>
            <p>And this couenant of faith, is concerning men to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by faith on Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This league in ſubſtance is truly one and the ſame, and hath alwayes beene and ſhall be: as being for Chriſt his ſake, vnto the ſame ſaluation.</p>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1866:140"/>the reſurrection of Chriſt, placed in ceremonies, which was to die, and now truly is dead: and is called old by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of time and vanity, becauſe that for oldnes it is vaniſhed away.</p>
            <p>The new is by Chriſt, with the Chriſtian people, alwaies to endure and new, clearely publiſhed by Chriſt, alwayes the ſame, wherein more men are renued: hence is it called new.</p>
            <p>Many truly were ſaued by this, before the comming of Chriſt, yet notwithſtanding becauſe this couenant was not clearely propounded, it was not then called new.</p>
            <p>Wherefore this teſtament in that regard is ſaid to be new, for that it containeth thoſe bookes which doe publiſh this teſtament, &amp; that in this maner, to wit more cleerely, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>The pen-men are foure, Matthew, Mark, Luke, Iohn.</p>
            <p>And they were onely pen-men as the particle, <hi>according,</hi> doth declare. The ſpirit ſuggeſted, they receaued: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe Mark was helped by Peter, and Luke by Paul.</p>
            <p>Why foure, why two of the Apoſtles, and two of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenty, why in this order we omit to enquire.</p>
            <p>Whom to vnderſtand, it will be profitable to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That they doe not after the ſame manner cite teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies out of the olde teſtament: for ſometimes they fetch them from the Hebrew, ſometimes from the Septuagint tranſlation, ſometimes they are caried with the free iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That they follow rather the ſummes of doctrine, then the accurate obſeruation of times.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That they doe not diſagree, howſoeuer ſome things may ſeeme to iarre.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That they put the Hebrew tongue for the Syriake.</p>
            <p n="5">5 They are inſpired of God.</p>
            <p n="6">6 They haue a generall and perpetuall doctrine.</p>
            <p>Matthew (who was before a publican) wrote firſt of all the eight yeere after the aſcention of Chriſt, and that (as ſome thinke) in the Hebrew tongue. Him Iohn tranſlated into Greeke, through the procurement of ſome. Marke
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1866:142"/>wrote two yeeres after Matthew, being taught by Peter, and firſt of all (as ſome ſay) in the Latine tongue.</p>
            <p>Luke inſtructed by Paule, wrote the fifteenth yeere after the aſcention of Chriſt. At length Iohn the thirty two yeeres after Chriſt. He ſurviewed the other three, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them, and writ downe againſt the heretiques, certaine things which were left out.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Why ſhould we not therefore learne out of theſe? ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord would haue ſuch, and ſo excellent Authors to pen theſe things, would he not haue al to read &amp; know the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?</p>
            <p n="2">2 And ſeeing theſe writings are inſpired by God, let vs reade and heare them with the direction of the ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Neither let vs euer think that this doctrine, confirmed with ſo many witneſſes, is to be doubted of. 4 And not with Ridly, Cromwell, Luther, to be conned by hart.</p>
            <p>Luk, 1, Chap: from the 1, ver. to the 5.</p>
            <p>Hitherto haue beene the inſcriptions: now follow the treatiſes to be compiled into one narration.</p>
            <p>Wherein are the praeface, and the narration.</p>
            <p>The praeface is in the 1 of Luk, 1, 2, 3, 4, verſe, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth three things, the perſon, the thing, the cauſes.</p>
            <p>The perſon is
<list>
                  <item>of the writer, <hi>Luke.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>vnto whom is written, the <hi>most noble Theophilus.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The thing, is the orderly writing of thoſe things, whereof we are fully perſwaded.</p>
            <p>The cauſes are,
<list>
                  <item>impulſiue.</item>
                  <item>finall.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The impulſiue cauſes are from compariſon of equals, or of leſſe, and they are three.</p>
            <p>The firſt, it is as meete that I ſhould as others, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture more.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, if they haue written being moued of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, why ſhould not I eſpecially write, being ſtirred vp by the ſpirit of God?</p>
            <p>The third, I haue knowne all things as certainly, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture
<pb facs="tcp:1866:143"/>more certainly then they: For <hi>they haue deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them vnto me, which from the beginning ſaw them their ſelues, and were Ministers of the word,</hi> and <hi>I haue ſearched out perfectly all things from the beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The final cauſe is, that Theophilus might know the truth of thoſe ſpeeches which he had heard.</p>
            <p>The party writing is Luke, by profeſſion a Phiſition, in regard of Country one of Antiochia, one (as Epiphanius ſaith) of the 70 Diſciples. Luk, 10, 1. This man is made an Euangeliſt, the 10 Apoſtles being paſſed by.</p>
            <p>Vnderſtand that God is tied to no man, and that he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth whom ſo euer he willeth, to what function ſo euer it pleaſeth him. Thus he made Paul that had beene a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, to become an Apoſtle, and alſo Peter who was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſherman.</p>
            <p>So that, 1 Wee ought to diſtruſt nothing which ſhall pleaſe the Lord, 2 Neither let vs indeede aſcribe any thing to ſecondarie cauſes, but all vnto God. 3 Wee ought ſo much the more to beleeue, becauſe wee ſee the power of God to ſhew it ſelfe in moſt contemptible things.</p>
            <p>Que. But why doth Luke alone take paines in wryting of a praeface?</p>
            <p>Aun. Not that his writings were not authenticall, but for that being inſtructed in Rethorique, he doth thus purchaſe fauour and attention (whence he is thought to haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the beſt Greeke:) as alſo that hee might ſatisfie the Church, requiring a reaſon of his fact, and might procure greateſt authority.</p>
            <p>Wherfore vſe of humane learning, conſiſting in tongues and Arts, is not at all altogether to be reiected, whiles it may ſerue to edefie the Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And godly men vndertake nothing wherof they haue not warrantable inducements. 3 We are alſo to take care that our doctrine may be moſt acceptable in the eyes of the world.</p>
            <p>The perſon vnto whom is written is <hi>Theophilus.</hi> Some thinke this name to be appellatiue, others proper: looke
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1866:143"/>Baronius. 533.</p>
            <p>He is <hi>most noble,</hi> that is, according to the Greeke, placed in authority.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Princes are not excluded from the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The godly honour the chiefe men in the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Chriſtians doe ſpeake courteouſly and ciuilly, neither doth that hinder which is in Iob, 32, 22.</p>
            <p>Que. But why writ Luke vnto this man?</p>
            <p>Aun. Not onely for priuate conſideration, (for perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture he had beene before inſtructed of Luke) but alſo for the good of the Church. For if a man in great place &amp; authority ſhal haue once receaued the word, others alſo will receaue the ſame.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Wherefore wee ought eſpecially labour to bring all thoſe vnto Chriſt, which are in any high place, not onely for themſelues, but for the Church, that others may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted vnto the faith, and confirmed in the ſame.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Godly men muſt be holily wiſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Neither doth this booke any thing more containe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular doctrine, becauſe of this compellation or dedication, then the Epiſtles of Paule.</p>
            <p>The thing it ſelfe followeth, which is the writing of an orderly diſpoſed narration, &amp;c, as was ſhewed before.</p>
            <p>Wherein are the
<list>
                  <item>manner, <hi>orderly dispoſed, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>matter, <hi>thoſe things whereof wee are fully perſwaded.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The manner containeth 3 things: narration, order, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>A narration is a plaine propounding, and ſetting forth of the thing as it is in it ſelfe, without any externall gloſing.</p>
            <p>So as the Euangeliſts ought to propound nothing which is not receaued: and no colouring is either to be ſet vpon it, or to be expected.</p>
            <p>The order, <hi>from point to point:</hi> with reſpect had of the time, that the truth might be more manifeſted, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie helped.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:144"/>
            <p> So likewiſe let vs alſo endeuour, to keepe in memorie, ſayings, and writings.</p>
            <p>Writing is a ſetting downe, in bookes or monuments.</p>
            <p>So as we ought to receaue nothing which is vnwritten.</p>
            <p>The matter followeth, <hi>thoſe things whereof wee are fully perſwaded.</hi> He meaneth the deedes and ſayings of Chriſt. Wherefore let vs heare of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſaid to be fully perſwaded of: the perſons in whom, <hi>we.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word in the Greeke which ſignifieth to be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of, is a metaphore borowed from ſhips, which are caried with full ſaile, and it ſignifieth a moſt certaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the truth, ſo as nothing can make vs to recoile from it, no not death, or any thing elſe.</p>
            <p>This perſwaſion is proper to faith, neceſſarily required in euery one of vs.</p>
            <p>The perſons, <hi>we,</hi> to wit the Diſciples and Apoſtles that were called, none other. Wherefore the Goſpel was in the world: neither was it beleeued of all.</p>
            <p>Let vs not therefore much diſquiet our ſelues, if now alſo all doe not beleeue the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing that Luke doth bring in the called alone, to beare witnes for the truth of this doctrine, let vs know that not what the world, but what the called doe, is to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>The cauſes follow, and firſt the impulſiue.</p>
            <p>The firſt, as was reheaſed before.</p>
            <p>Theſe men were, <hi>many.</hi> Cerinthus, Merinthus, as Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan: ſaith. 186.</p>
            <p>Apelles, Baſilides, and others, vnder the names of Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, Matthew, as Ambr: witneſſeth, alſo vnder the names of Iames, and Nichodemus. Peraduenture he meaneth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which had written before him, men inſpired of God: but theſe were not many, they were onely two.</p>
            <p>The force of the reaſon is: that wee ought to be as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent for the true doctrine, as others are for that which is falſe.</p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:1866:144"/>
            <p> We gather therefore that diuers forged, Apocriphall, and ſuch like writings ſhould be in the Church. So as there is required very great iudgement in reading.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let vs not be diſmayed with Popiſh writings, but let vs try all things, and keepe that which is good.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That euery man is according to his place, to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with falſe teachers.</p>
            <p>And theſe onely haue taken in hand, not finiſhed: but I will (ſaith Luke) goe thorough withall.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon: they did it of their owne heads, but I doe it by the inſtigation of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Obſerue that wicked men doe intrude themſelues into matters without a calling: that godly men vndertake du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, God onely mouing them.</p>
            <p>Que. But it may be demaunded, how I ſhal know that I am ſtirred vp of God to doe any thing.</p>
            <p>Aun. By obſeruing theſe things. 1 That the worke be honeſt. 2 That you be furniſhed with gifts neceſlatie for the diſcharge of it. 3 That mouing authority concurre, God within vs, the Church or the common-wealth, or the family without vs. 4 That you ſeeke to obay God, and to doe good vnto others.</p>
            <p>The third reaſon is in the verſe, 2, 3.
<note place="margin">

            <p>The worke of others is, <hi>as they haue deliuered them vnto vs, which from the beginning, &amp;c.</hi> by whom is meant the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. For theſe were they <hi>which ſaw them their ſelues, and were Ministers of the word.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>By <hi>the word,</hi> ſome vnderſtand Chriſt not vnſitly: but Luke doth not vſe to ſpeake ſo. I thinke therefore that the preaching of the Goſpell is meant: looke Piſcator vpon this place.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:145"/>
            <p> I gather, 1 That the word of God is knowne to no body from himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That the word of God is moſt excellent, where-vnto the Apoſtles haue ſerued as Miniſters: ſo as none ought to contemne the baſe function of the miniſterie.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That thoſe which ſaw, and were miniſters of the word, miniſtred vnto the word, and not vnto themſelues.</p>
            <p>The action is, <hi>haue deliuered:</hi> that is, haue related by word of mouth.</p>
            <p>Is there place then to be giuen vnto traditions? yes ſurely to written traditions, but not to vnwritten: excepting only ſuch as appertaine to decent and comely order, and not to godlines.</p>
            <p>Obſerue. 1 That thoſe which ſaw, had not forgotten the word.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That they rehearſed to others thoſe things which they knew themſelues.</p>
            <p>Hitherto concerning the worke of others towards him: now followeth his owne endeuour, <hi>hee had ſearched out all things perfectly from the beginning.</hi> The act, <hi>he had ſearched out.</hi> The obiect, <hi>all things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He ſearched out,</hi> not only ſought after, as namely who had learned and vnderſtoode them.</p>
            <p>Obſeru: 1 That Luke followed after holy men. 2 He looked for fruit by conuerſing with them, and ſeeketh after all things that appertaine vnto Chriſt, from them that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode them.</p>
            <p n="3">3 He doth not giue ouer before he hath attained.</p>
            <p n="4">4 He getteth that which he ſeeketh. Our trauaile is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in vaine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perfectly.</hi> 1 As that nothing was wanting. 2 Hee will not ſlightly know theſe things but thoroughly: for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to haue all, and to make vſe of. This muſt be our ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, neither is it blamed, if it be not moſt fruitfull. It muſt be moſt diligent, for inſtruction and vſe, to enforme o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All things,</hi> they be the ſpeeches and deeds of Chriſt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1866:145"/>not all, but ſuch as were neceſſary vnto ſaluation: for the world could not containe the bookes that ſhould be written of all.</p>
            <p>Vnderſtand therefore that wholſome thinges are to be ſought out.</p>

            <p>Alſo he ſearched out theſe things from the beginning, which reſpecteth the order, namely from the firſt miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Iohn. And he went thorough vnto the end. Thus alſo we muſt doe.</p>
            <p>Hitherto were the impulſiue cauſes:
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋerſe, </seg>4</label> now followeth the finall, <hi>that thou mightest acknowledge,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Wherein are certaine propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Theophilus was inſtructed in the word.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Yet the acknowledging of the truth is neceſſarie.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Theophilus did not at the firſt acknowledge the truth of thoſe things whereof he had heard.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Luke wrote the Goſpell, that Theophilus might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the truth.</p>
            <p>The doctrine and vſe is manifold.</p>
            <p>Obſerue out of the firſt propoſition. 1 What catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or inſtructing is.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That it ought to goe before.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That Catechiſing and a larger maner of expounding, and applying the word of God, are for ſubſtance all one. Onely after Catechiſing a more accurate and large expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That Theophilus, a man of ripe yeeres was catechiſed, and ſtoode in neede thereof: ſo as we ought not to ſcorne it. That it is alſo neceſſary. And ſeeing we are inſtructed from our youth, there is good reaſon why we ought to be more learned.</p>
            <p>But how if we haue cauſe to examine our ſelues, &amp; ſearch whether we haue no neede of Catechiſing?</p>
            <p n="5">5 That Theophilus, a moſt excellent man for place and
<pb facs="tcp:1866:146"/>ofspring, gaue his minde vnto catechiſing, and that he ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo much time from his owne buſines to beſtow on this.</p>
            <p>Obſerue out of the ſecond propoſition. 1 What is that which is tranſlated certaintie, namely, that truth whereof a man is perſwaded.</p>
            <p>Whereon who ſo euer reſteth, he ſhall neuer fall, nor miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carie.</p>
            <p>Of ſuch is the word of God in it ſelfe. Wherfore fearefull is the ſpeech of one, calling the Hiſtorie of Chriſt a fable.</p>

            <p>Now acknowledgement hath, 1 More full vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. 2 Diſtinction. 3 Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Out of the third propoſition, after the proofe of it, ſearch whether in the world there is not alwayes the ſame ſlacknes in the hearers of the word: which wee ſhall vnderſtand by the cauſes of it: which are, 1 The excellencie of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine it ſelfe, going beyond our capacitie, which euen not Adam knew in paradiſe. 2 The deprauation of our nature. 3 The ſpiritual aduerſaries. 4 The ſlender vſing of meanes. 5 The contempt of the doctrine it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Que. But whence may wee be able to iudge of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging?</p>
            <p>Aun. Out of the former.</p>
            <p>Theophilus being learned, yet did not he ſufficiently vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Much leſſe did the vnlearned.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Obſerue that ignorance if it will amend it ſelfe, and goe on to acknowledgement, doth not condemne.</p>
            <p>Luke doth not forſake rude Theophilus.</p>
            <p>Out of the fourth propoſition obſerue. 1 That to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the truth, meanes are requiſite. 2 That the care of the Miniſters muſt be, that the hearers may haue the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie.</p>
            <p>But why? Aun. Not onely for the ſolid comfort of the hearers, but vnleſſe the certainty be acknowledged, the godly ſhal halt in their duties. For they ſhal not ſo put their

            <p n="3">3 That writing is ſufficient to perſwade touching the certainty, and therefore miracles are not to be expected.</p>
            <p n="4">4 If once writing ſufficed, ought not much more, ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reading and preaching eſtabliſh our faith?</p>
            <p>Iohn, 1, Chap: from the 1, ver: to the 15.</p>
            <p>Hitherto hath beene the praeface: the narration follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, in the reſt of the whole body of the Goſpels.</p>
            <p>And it is
<list>
                  <item>ſummarie, of the whole Goſpell.</item>
                  <item>particular and diſtinct of euery ſeuerall branch.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The ſummarie narration is contained in the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Iohn, from the beginning of the firſt ver: to the end of the 14.</p>
            <p>And it is concerning our Sauiour Chriſt, God &amp; man, and that either in himſelfe, or in the miniſterie of Iohn the Baptiſt, both which (the order ſcarſely obſerued) are heere contained.</p>
            <p>Now the ſum of the 14 verſes, is a deſcription of Chriſt, God and man. Whereof are two parts: the former tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his deitie, the latter touching his humanity.</p>
            <p>That which is touching his deitie, is from the firſt verſe to the end of the 13. Wherein he auoucheth that Chriſt is God, ſhewing it himſelf, as alſo confirming it by teſtimonie.</p>
            <p>He ſheweth it in the ver: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>In the doctrine touching Chriſt his dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, two things are to be conſidered, his
<list>
                  <item>eſſence.</item>
                  <item>perſon.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>His eſſence in the ve: beginning &amp; ending, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>And heere are comprehended, his eternitie, the name, and appellation of God, his effects.</p>
            <p>The perſon is noted in theſe words, <hi>was with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His eternitie is propounded in the firſt verſe, repeated in the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Seeing the Church by way of teaching vſeth the words of eſſence and perſon (although they be not found in the ſcripture) we are to expound the ſame.</p>
            <p>The eſſence is, that whereby the deity hath his being, and
<pb facs="tcp:1866:147"/>it is common.</p>
            <p>The perſon is, that whereby the deity is diſtinguiſhed, &amp; it is proper.</p>
            <p>There is only one eſſence, but a three fold perſon, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Sonne, the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>This is therefore the drift of Iohn, namely to ſhew that Chriſt is both God, and alſo a diſtinct perſon.</p>
            <p>This is the ſumme, now let vs conſider the words of the text.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋerſe, </seg>1</label> In the firſt verſe are contained three propoſitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the beginning was the word,</hi> this is the firſt propoſition, for the deitie of Chriſt, proued from his eternitie, the moſt plaine and naturall diſpoſition whereof is thus. The word was in the beginning.</p>
            <p>And heere may be conſidered, the
<list>
                  <item>ſubiect, <hi>the word.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>attribute, was in the beginning.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Greeke word which is tranſlated Word, ſignifieth either reaſon, or ſpeech. Tertullian in this place doth tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate it reaſon.</p>
            <p>But we will not innouate any thing. The Engliſh tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation hath it, <hi>word,</hi> it had beene better <hi>ſpeech,</hi> but that vſe hath ſo preuailed. For a word is but one, ſpeech doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of many, which reſpect is agreeable to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>All doe agree that by the vvord is meant, Chriſt, namely he of whom all we, and the new teſtament doe ſo clearely preach: but all doe not agree in the ſame motion or reaſon of it.</p>
            <p>We omit nice and crabbed queſtions, onely we wil ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to doe good.</p>
            <p>This word may be taken, 1 paſſiuely, touching whom the word is. 2 Actiuely, who is the word and the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe that both wayes, it may rightly be vnderſtood in this place. For the whole ſpeech of the ſcriptures is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, Iohn, 1, 45. Luk, 24, 25, 27, ver.</p>
            <p>Actiuely, by a metaphor, who hath diſcloſed the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1866:147"/>of God the Father touching our ſaluation, Iohn, 1, 18. Heb: 1, 1, Iohn, 4, 25. Math. 17, 5.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant what the Fathers ſay, concerning ſpeech vttered by mouth, and conceaued in the mind.</p>
            <p>Theſe things which are ſpoken of Chriſt, are to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, all others excluded.</p>
            <p>Vſe.</p>
            <p>Seeing that all ſpeech in the ſcripture is touching Chriſt, let vs ſeeke him in our reading and hearing.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And ſeeing he ſpeaketh of the counſell of God, let vs heare him.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It is a great matter to beare the name of a Preacher, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering this word.</p>
            <p>Obſerue the excellencie of the word.</p>
            <p>Hitherto hath beene the ſubiect, now followeth the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, <hi>was in the beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beginning heere is meant in regard of time, when things began to be: wherefore in the 1 of Iohn, 1, Chap: 1, ver: it is ſaid from the beginning.</p>
            <p>Que. Began he therefore then to be, as ſome heretiques thought?</p>
            <p>Aun. No: for the affirming of the preſent, doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the time paſt: but Iohn would haue it thus vnderſtood, when things began, then this word appeared, as 1, Gen. and the 3. Gen: 15, after the fall, not when he was firſt brought forth into the world.</p>
            <p>The word is from eternity, but as ſoone as time is, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth.</p>
            <p>That wee might alwayes ſet before our eyes the vvord. And ſeeke him.</p>
            <p>Neither iudge of things euer according to outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Was,</hi> that is, ſubſiſted in the preterperfect tenſe, declaring his eternitie; hee is God from himſelfe, a perſon from the Father, by an vnvtterable manner of begetting. Math. 3, 17. Luk, 3, 22.</p>
            <p>And this word <hi>was,</hi> declareth him to haue beene God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:1866:148"/>all worlds.</p>
            <p>Euery eternall thing is God. The heathen &amp; heretiques are condemned, and all the Iewes, which denie the eternitie of Chriſt.</p>

            <p>The particle <hi>(and,)</hi> declareth that it is not ſufficient to beleeue the vvord to be God, but alſo a diſtinct perſon.</p>
            <p>The ſentence will be cleare, after theſe words are opened, <hi>with God.</hi>

            <p>With whom to be, ſheweth that the father and the ſonne haue each their being. Now this cannot be but in equall &amp; diſtinct perſons. The Father therefore is one, the Sonne is another: ſee the 3 of Math: 16, 17. Math: 28, 19.</p>
            <p>This diſtinction is onely by an incommunicable proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the father begetteth, the ſonne is begotten.</p>
            <p>In theſe things let vs be wiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſcriptures, in our

            <p>Equality is by which the vvord is in eſſence, diuine attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, and works equall.</p>
            <p>But it may be obiected: the Father is greater then the Sonne.</p>
            <p>Aun. In regard of humaine nature, not otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Vſe.</p>
            <p>Let vs remember that God is ſo to be worſhipped, as the miſterie of the Trinity requireth, otherwiſe wee ſhall not worſhip him.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That there is the ſame nature, will, &amp;c. of the vvord,

            <p>The third propoſition, <hi>and that word was God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Word,</hi> as before, alſo the verbe <hi>was. God</hi> in this place is not put perſonally but eſſentially, as it is vſed vpon euery of the three perſons: otherwiſe the ſame ſhould be affirmed of the ſame, the word is the word.</p>
            <p>Expreſly therefore the word is called God, neither is it ſo called onely, but alſo is ſo indeede. Many teſtimonies may be heere heaped vp.</p>
            <p>Vſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Though the word be God, yet is there but one God.</p>
            <p>Que. How can it be that 3 ſhould be called God, and there be onely one.</p>
            <p>Aun. Very well: by reaſon of the indiuiſiblenes of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. It is alſo a moſt profound miſterie, where-into we are not to diue.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The cauill of Arrius is excluded, calling Chriſt a made God. He was God from himſelfe before all times.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The word of Chriſt, and concerning Chriſt, is diuine.</p>
            <p>Heere-vnto we are moſt diligently to attend.</p>

            <p>That the Word created all things, the Euangeliſt ſheweth by a diſtribution. For all things that are, are either voyd of life, liuing creatures, endued with a reaſonable ſoule: theſe the Word made, therefore all things.</p>
            <p>The 3 verſe ſerueth to proue the firſt part of the minor propoſition: the fourth and fift doe ſerue for the ſecond and third.</p>
            <p>The 3 ver: is enlarged by a <hi>Pleonaſmus,</hi> as Iohn, 1, 20. Pſal. 40, 10, 11. Eſa, 38, 1.</p>
            <p>And it hath two propoſitions. The firſt: <hi>all things were made by it.</hi> The ſecond: <hi>and without it was made nothing that was made.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It,</hi> that is, the vvord, Heb. 1, 10. Pſal. 102, 26. Heb. 1, 2. Yet not alone, but with the Father, and the holy Ghoſt. The works of the Trinitie vnto any thing without,
<note place="margin">Opera ad extra.</note> are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from any perſon: wherefore the Iewes obſerue that the name of God is of the plurall number.</p>
            <p>Que. Why therefore doth the Euangeliſt ſo diligently ſet downe that which is now ſo common &amp; vulgar a thing in diuinitie?</p>
            <p>Aun. The miſterie of the Trinitie was not ſo diſtinctly knowne. Adde to this, that the Iewes did acknowledge ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one God, then three perſons, and truly leaſt of all ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed they the ſonne of Mary to haue been God.</p>
            <p>Vſe.</p>

            <p>He doth alſo no leſſe giue vnto vs then he did at the firſt create: that if we haue any thing, we are to render thanks vnto him.</p>
            <p>The things made, are, <hi>all things,</hi> which conſidered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they argue his power, ſeuerally, his wiſedome &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.

            <p>All things are meant that Angels may not be excluded, and inuiſible ſpirits, yea the whole world.</p>
            <p>Wherfore thoſe Philoſophers erre which make the world to haue no beginning.</p>

            <p>Aun. No: an euill thing was neuer made, therefore it is not by the vvord.</p>
            <p>Que. What is then the originall of ſinne?</p>

            <p>The particle, <hi>in,</hi> delareth that it is in the vvord, as in a fountaine, that it may be transfuſed into the Church.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we are rather to vnderſtand it of life transfuſed

            <p>We gather therefore. 1 That the Word is the fountain of life, Iohn, 5, 26, Acts, 17, 28, Colo, 3, 4. Iohn, 14, 6.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the name nature is wiſely to be vſed.</p>

            <p>The Word is light, that is, the fountaine of this manifold light, yet notwithſtanding, this place is to be vnderſtood of naturall light, as it may appeare out of the 9. verſe.</p>
            <p>And it is the reaſonable ſoule with the faculties &amp; inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hereof the Word is the maker, which becauſe from the firſt creation of it, it had a knowledge of diuine truth, &amp; now hath certaine ſparkles thereof, it is called light: and that truly, not onely becauſe it is precious as light, but for that as the Sunne hath it ſelfe to the world, ſo this light vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Men,</hi> are all, and euery one: ſo that of neceſsitie we are to vnderſtand this of naturall light, eyther before, or after the fall.</p>
            <p>He was alſo the light of Angels, but the ſpeech is direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to men, he ſpeaketh nothing of Angels.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the words, the vſe followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The principall thing in a man is his reaſonable ſoule, for the beautifying whereof we are to labour.</p>
            <p n="2">2 So is the Word light, as that he doth impart and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the ſame.</p>
            <p>Hee giueth the ſoule indeede after a ſpeciall manner, in putting it into the body he createth it, and in creating it he
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1866:151"/>doth put it in.</p>
            <p>It is not by propagation.</p>
            <p>It is not a portion of diuine eſſence.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That witneſſe and skill whereſoeuer they be, are to be acknowledged the gifts of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Seeing that God doth inſtill natural light, there is cauſe why we ſhould encreaſe the ſame for the vſe of this life.</p>
            <p n="5">5 If naturall light be from the Word, is not much more ſupernaturall: ſo as we are more to labour for this.</p>
            <p>Thus hath beene the propoſition:
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe. </seg>5</label> the explication re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, 5, verſe, and it is from an euent that the light ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was not comprehended. VVhere are two ſentences. 1 The light ſhineth in the darkeneſſe. 2 The darknes do not comprehend the light.</p>
            <p>In the firſt ſentence we are to ſearch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the light it ſelfe, and the attribute, or that which is affirmed of it.</p>
            <p>Light is either God, or a creature.</p>
            <p>Light is put for God, as 1, Ioh, 1, 5. Now the name of God is taken eſſentially, and is truly vſed vpon the 3. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>But heere it is applied and attributed vnto the Word, as it appeareth out of the context. Beſides Chriſt himſelfe, Iohn, 8, 12. calleth himſelfe light.</p>
            <p>Indeed moſt iuſtly. Who was not only prefigured in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> of the Prieſts, but alſo in the Candleſtick.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, Eſay, 60, 2, and Luke 1, 78. In which reſpect alſo hee may be called the day ſtarre, 2, Pet, 1, 19, Mala, 4, 2, he is called a ſunne. Hence the imitation into Chriſt is called light, 2, Cor, 4, 4, &amp; we are ſaid to haue receiued light, Heb, 10, 32.</p>
            <p>Now Chriſt is called light by a metaphor or borrowed kind of ſpeech. 1 For that he is the brightneſſe of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his Father, Heb, 1, 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2 For that there ſhineth vnto vs the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Ieſus Chriſt, 2, Cor, 4, 6.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That as the light is ſome ſpirituall thing, ſo it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the Word, as he is conſidered in himſelfe with the
<pb facs="tcp:1866:152"/>Father, is of that nature.</p>
            <p n="4">4 VVhat things the light effecteth, he doth much more, namely to lay things open, to declare differences, to ſhew the way vnto our feete. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Becauſe there is no darkneſſe in him, that is no ſin, nor affection to it.</p>
            <p n="6">6 And becauſe it is moſt excellent light, as that it can darken the ſight of the eye, which we can neuer thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behold.</p>
            <p>Queſt. How are the Apoſtles ſaid to be the light of the world?</p>
            <p>Aun. By reaſon of the light of doctrine.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let vs know, 1 That what things we would know touching God the Father, the ſame are to belearned from this light: He is in the boſome of the Father
<note n="*" place="margin">Ezegeſato,</note> he hath declared him, heare him.</p>
            <p n="2">2 When as the light ſhineth in the face of Chriſt, it is in regard of his incarnation, otherwiſe wee were not able to perceiue the brightneſſe. Wherefore euen as they which ſee the ecclipſe of the ſunne in the water, ſo let vs behold God through the ſleſh.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That carnall and ſenſuall thoughts are to be remoued. This light is a ſpirit, and to be worſhipped in ſpirit, and to be beheld by the eyes of the mind. Indeed we ſhall ſee with our bodily eyes, his body in heauen.</p>
            <p n="4">4 As Chriſt layeth all things open, ſo eſpecially thoſe things which appertaine vnto ſaluation, Eſay, 9, 2. Luke, 1, 79, Luke, 2, 32. Without him there is no light vnto ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherefore Paule, Ephe, 3, 4. Chriſt is the key of the Scriptures, &amp;c. He is he that giueth light.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Yea, he bewrayeth as light, what difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Law, and the Goſpell. Heb, 5, 14, Philip, 1, 10.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Hee ſheweth the way vnto heauen, he is the light, the life, and the way: without him we ſhall wander, and goe out of the way.</p>
            <p n="7">7 None can truly belieue in Chriſt, and yet haue a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſinne.</p>
            <pb n="89" facs="tcp:1866:152"/>
            <p> What communion is there betwixt light and darknes? The light ſcattereth darknes.</p>
            <p>This is the ſubiect, the attribute followeth. <hi>Shineth in the darknes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſhine, in this place, is to ſhew it ſelfe cleerely. For it is the Sunne.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the time is to be conſidered, which ſignifieth that it is now, and continuall.</p>
            <p>Who therefore would not open his eyes, conſidering that Chriſt ſhineth, Eſa. 60, 1.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Seeing Chriſt had no neede to ſhine to himſelfe, but onely to his, why ſhould not we ſhine to others, and not hide the good things we haue?</p>
            <p n="3">3 At the time when Iohn wrote, Chriſt had aſcended into heauen, and yet he ſaith that he now ſhineth, euen as he did before.</p>
            <p>Wherefore now alſo he ſhineth, that if we would open our eyes, we cannot be ignorant. Let vs take heede that this be not our condemnation, that the light came into the world, and we loued darknes.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And ſeeing he doth continually ſhine, men ſhall be without excuſe.</p>
            <p>But he <hi>ſhineth in the darknes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Darknes is
<list>
                  <item>properly, to the eyes.</item>
                  <item>improperly, to the minde.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The light truly ſhineth euery where, yet notwithſtanding there is this darknes of the minde.</p>
            <p>By darknes, is meant a thing that is darke, the adiunct be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put for the ſubiect, as wickednes for a wicked man.</p>
            <p>This darknes therefore are men, as Ephe. 5, 8, hence are the works of darknes. Truly ſuch are men by nature after the fall. Where wee are to conſider the affection and the meaſure.</p>
            <p>The affection or priuation, is a loſſe of light. This light was the glory of the image of God, ſeated in the mind, and in the will.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:153"/>
            <p> This is wholy loſt in matters of ſaluation.</p>
            <p>The meaſure is ſo great, that we are darknes it ſelfe, not onely darke, and ſurely the very darknes of Aegypt that might be felt, which doe not onely want light, but alſo ſhut it out, that how great this darknes is, we can hardly iudge.</p>
            <p n="1">1 How great therefore is our miſerie, ſo long as we liue in the darknes of our minds, and of our wils.</p>
            <p n="2">2 So, as that we ſee this to be the cauſe of ignorance, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and all manner of ſinnes.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Neither are we able to doe any thing ſo long as we are in this darknes, where-with we are ouer-whelmed.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Why doe we not therefore vſe all meanes that we may be in the light?</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſentence or propoſition is this, and the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes comprehended it not.</p>
            <p>Whatſoeuer difficultie is in this place, it is in the word, <hi>comprehended,</hi> which properly ſignifieth to hold all. The whole light all the creatures are not able to containe: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the Euangeliſt ſignifie this. It is certaine that the fault of darknes is heere meant, which is, that they had not apprehended it, rather then not comprehended it.</p>
            <p>Neither is this not apprehending euery way condemned. For who apprehendeth what things were done before the world? Heere therefore is reprehended the not apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of thoſe things, which are neceſſary to ſaluation. Of which condition are theſe: to be ignorant that the VVord is God, that the VVord ought to be made man, that he is the Sauiour of the world, that he is to be layd hold on by faith.</p>
            <p>A man may be in the middeſt of light, he himſelfe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding remaining blind. Wherefore let vs not footh vp our ſelues in the bare hauing of the meanes.</p>
            <p n="2">2 We ſinne greeuouſly, if we ſee not the light which ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</p>
            <p>Then God reputeth vs not to comprehend the light, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we be ignorant of thoſe things which tend to our owne fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:1866:154"/> 2 Secondly, to trie our faith: for if God himſelfe, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſhould teach, we might for feare attend; but when men like our ſelues, ſubiect to the like, and greater paſſions then our ſelues, teach, and we learne, it is manifeſt that the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth preuaileth with vs.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore attend to the miniſteries of men, not loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for Angels or reuelations.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing that Iohn was ſo a man, as that he had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outward grace of countenance, friends, ſpeech, &amp;c: let vs know that theſe outward things giue no ſound force to the word, to preuaile with our conſciences, but onely that which carrieth, is the euident truth of the word of God.</p>
               <p>His warrant followeth, <hi>ſent from God:</hi> where marke that Iohn would doe nothing without his warrant, no more ſhould we.</p>
               <p>Now heere we may conſider, the party ſending, <hi>God:</hi> the kind of Iohns warrant, <hi>ſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> is Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, who onely is able, and carefull to ſend. Math. 28, 18, 19. Ephe. 4, 11. Mathew, 9, 38.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Wherefore we wanting Iohns, are in Gods diſpleaſure; deſirous to haue them, muſt ſeeke to him; hauing them, muſt thank him for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Iohns ſent, muſt carry themſelues in compaſſe of their commiſſion, as being ſent from God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 All muſt entertaine ſuch as are ſent from GOD accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, with due reſpect of the ſender.</p>
               <p>The kind of Iohns warrant followeth, <hi>ſent,</hi> that is, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing direction what to doe, was commaunded to goe about it. God commaunded thus by his word, Luk. 3, 2.</p>
               <p>One might aske, whether this word were by mouth, or to the minds, immediate by God himſelfe, or ſome others: but it is more curious then needeth. It was moſt like to be to Iohns mind, by the inſtinct of the holy Ghoſt, which Iohn had from his mothers wombe, Luk, 1, 15.</p>
               <p>For it is not probable, that in thoſe corrupt times, any ſhould whet on, Iohn outwardly. Iohn began his miniſterie
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1866:154"/>ſome-what before Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This word of God to Iohn, implieth a ſufficiencie in Iohn. God neuer ſendeth but ſuch as are furniſhed with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliments for the duties doing: ſuch ability is called a gift.</p>
               <p>As Iohn did, ſo muſt all, not goe about any thing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, as warrant, ſo in particular, and from the word of God, ſo as all muſt be certaine, that they are ſent.</p>
               <p>Que. How may that be, will ſome body ſay?</p>
               <p>Aun. When I haue a gift, and authority will haue me vſe it.</p>
               <p>When may I iudge I haue a gift? When I haue vſed the meanes, and haue approbation of thoſe who are to try, and iudge.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Authority is of God in his word, allowing by his ſpirit, ſtirring to be willing to vſe our gift.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Men calling to the vſe thereof, and ſetting (to that end) in ſome place.</p>
               <p>It may be ſaid Iohn was not ſo, he had no calling of or from men. Aun. Sending or calling is ordinarie, or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie.</p>
               <p>Ordinarie requireth alwayes humaine authority, ſo doth not extraordinarie.</p>
               <p>Indeede extraordinarie, though it haue not vocation of men before, yet it hath approbation of them for afterward, as the ſeale for ratifying of the ſending. Now then Iohns calling was extraordinarie.</p>
               <p>This calling hath place in diſordered Churches, which are beginning to be reformed, not in ſetled and confirmed Churches. Of the former kind the Iewes Church was, when Iohn firſt came.</p>
               <p>By this may we aunſwer our aduerſaries of the Church of Rome, demaunding vs whence Luther &amp; Zuinglius came, being ſent from no humaine authoritie, whence the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters who after ſucceeded ſprang, ſince none were made by Biſhops, vſually ſo called.</p>
               <p>Theſe mens firſt calling in part, was extraordinarie, and therefore could haue no humaine authority, which was ſo
<pb facs="tcp:1866:155"/>diſordered, as that it had neede to be reformed.</p>
               <p>The times were as thoſe in which Iohn Baptiſt came: it may appeare by Gods rayſing vp Zuinglius and Luther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one time in ſundry places, neither knowing of other: by the wonderfull gifts of the ſpirit they had: by Luthers ſtrange preſeruation, and bringing on ſtill to ſee more and more: by their ſucceſſe, that in part their calling was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, they were made elders by their ordinarie Biſhops, and they being elders, ordained others ſucceſſiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>
               <p>The learned know that Biſhop and elder, ſo called in the ſcriptures, differ not much: ſo as that way, they had warrant enough.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the approbation of the Church, and ſucceſſe, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſheweth the lawfulnes of their comming &amp; refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
               <p>This ſending is mentioned, as being that which will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford courage to any in his place.</p>
               <p>His name <hi>Iohn,</hi> of a word, which ſignifieth to ſhew fauor and grace.</p>
               <p>Now he was thus called, becauſe God beſtowed him vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his parents in their old age as a ſpeciall grace &amp; fauour, and for that he ſhould be a chiefe Preacher of grace. This name was fore-told, Luk, 1, 13. giuen Luk, 1, 60.63.</p>
               <p>One Iohn, writ this Goſpell, and is called he whom Ieſus loued: this mentioned heere is not he.</p>
               <p>Another is the Baptiſt, who came preaching and bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: this is Iohn, that is the Baptiſt.</p>
               <p>Now ſithence the ſpirit of God noteth names, let vs know he looketh to greater matters: 2, and let vs not be ſecure, euen in the leaſt: 3, beſides, when we haue occaſion to giue names, let vs appoint ſuch as may put vs in mind of ſome good.</p>

               <p>Iohns readineſſe, appeareth in that it is ſayd, he came without delay after he was furniſhed with giftes, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by calling.</p>
               <p>So muſt euery one of vs, after enabling by giftes, called of God, not defer.</p>
               <p>God was angrie with Moſes for excuſing: he puniſhed Ionas for ſtarting aſide; if any diſcouragements ſhould haue preuailed they might with Iohn, but he brake thorough all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hee witneſſed.</hi> To witneſſe, is to ſhew ſome-what of anie thing.</p>
               <p>Iohn ſhewed 1 the truth, Iohn, 10, 41, 2 He made things more cleere, as witneſſes ſhould, he pointed to the Lambe of God.</p>
               <p>It may be obiected Iohn, 5, 33, 34, as though Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed his witneſſe.</p>
               <p>Aunſw. Chriſt ſpeaketh there as not needing himſeffe Iohns teſtimonie, Chriſt himſelfe was of ſufficient credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p>But heere it is ſaid, Iohn <hi>came to witneſſe,</hi> for the Church, which had neede, and to make things cleere to it, which it could not eaſily perceiue.</p>
               <p>Mark then how carefull the Lord is for his Church, that though himſelfe neede none, yet will vſe men for their own benefit, ſo as that if we ſhould not profit thereby, we ſhould be too too forgetfull of our owne good.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And that we had neede to haue things made eaſie, as well as thoſe to whom Iohn came.</p>
               <p>Queſt. How did Iohn witneſſe, by word, worke, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſome or all?</p>
               <p>Aun. Onely by word, he did no miracle, Iohn, 10, 41, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:1866:156"/>yet hee was an extraordinary man, and his miniſterie verie ſtrange. Whereby we may perceiue our aduerſaries haue ſmal reaſon to require them of Luther, Zuinglius, &amp;c, more then of Iohn. Wee teach the ſame doctrine that Iohn and Chriſt did, and haue the ſame miracles which hee did for confirmation. So as that himſelfe ſhould be a monſter, who ſhould now looke for miracles, which often the wicked &amp; hypocrites haue doone.</p>
               <p>Chriſt was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with one Iohns witnes. How vnexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable ſhould we be, not belieuing ſo many Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Martyrs, Teachers, &amp;c?</p>
               <p>Iohn bare witneſſe <hi>of the light.</hi> The light before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is called <hi>the Word.</hi> Al the Miniſtery is to ſpread abroad this light. All hearing ſhould be to be enlightned heerin.</p>
               <p>The end, <hi>that all, &amp;c,</hi> ſhortly it is, that there ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To belieue,</hi> is a word that cannot be vnderſtood without reſpect to another. Somewhat muſt one belieue. It is heere to be vnder-ſtoode as Iohn witneſſed: ſo as the meaning is, that they might belieue that which Iohn witneſſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Iohn did witneſſe that he was God, 2 made man, 3 ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the ſinnes of the world, 4 they had withall a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led purpoſe to belieue, whatſoeuer more ſhould be reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led touching this light, elſe had they not ſufficiently belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
               <p>Now belieuing in it ſelfe, is to take knowledge of the thing that I belieue, what it is, and what the meaning of it is. 2 To be perſwaded that that which I belieue is true, &amp; worthy to be reſpected euen to my good, whereuppon I will indure any thing rather then ſhrinke from it. 3 To ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it particularly vnto my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Now this end was intended by God, and Iohn, and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>And it is made knowne, by the parties whom it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and the inſtrument thereof.</p>
               <p>The parties are <hi>all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scripture vſeth to ſay all, of ſome, ſaith Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:1866:156"/>
               <p> So doth it heere <hi>all,</hi> that is ſundry ſorts, not all and euery particuler.</p>
               <p>Thus ſometimes it ſignifieth the greater part, ſometime the better, and may be diſcerned by the place where it is.</p>
               <p>Heere it is the beſt, ſuch as are ordained to ſaluation, for thoſe are the beſt part of the world: ſo as that theſe all, are ſuch who are appointed to ſaluation, and life euerlaſting: none other. Indeede diuers haue outward meanes, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with intent on Gods part to haue them bleſſed: For he will haue ſome hardned, and not belieue in his euerlaſting decree, though they continue in vnbeliefe by theyr owne ſinne.</p>
               <p>So as that it is not true, that God in his euerlaſting coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile would haue euery particuler man in the world ſaued.</p>
               <p>Indeed ſuch generall ſpeeches are vſed, 1 to teach vs that we ſhould not giue definitiue ſentence of any, to ſay ſuch a one is a reprobate, that onely is in God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That when we heare or reade, the Word to ſpeake ſo at large, our ſelues euery one ſhould particularly applie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſelues.</p>
               <p n="3">3 VVhen we find our ſelues to beleeue, we ſhould not lift vp our ſelues in conceit aboue others. God is no other to vs then to others. He is all in his mercy.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the parties. Now followeth the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>by him:</hi> that is, by Iohn, who was the meane or occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their beleeuing: ſo 1, Cor, 3, 5. Paule and Apollo are ſayd to be the Miniſters, by whom the Corinthians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued.</p>
               <p>So God ordeineth, that mans miniſterie ſhould be the meanes of beleeuing.</p>
               <p>So God bleſſeth it to occaſion faith, as euery where in the ſcriptures may appeare.</p>
               <p>Marke then that of conſcience, we ought to attend to the miniſterie of men.</p>
               <p>That we may looke for a bleſſing in conſcionably, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thereunto.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:157"/>
               <p> That howſoeuer men be occaſions of beleeuing, yet are they not the onely cauſes. God muſt be ſought vnto, and bleſſe, els all other is nothing.</p>
               <p>Hetherto the ſetting downe of Iohn Baptiſtes office ſimply in it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Now foloweth the compariſon with Chriſt in the 8 verſe,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe, </seg>8</label> &amp; ſo forward, wherin Chriſt and Iohn are compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as diuerſe. In all which diſcourſe ſomewhat is denied of Iohn, many thinges are affirmed of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It is denied of Iohn that he was <hi>that light verſe, 8,</hi> and yet leaſt any man ſhould miſtake, as though the Euangeliſt ſhould gaineſay any thing which he had deliuered before, he repeateth the laſt clauſe touching the cheefe poynt of Iohns miniſterie, that though he were not <hi>that light,</hi> yet <hi>he bare witneſſe of the light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be demanded, how it can be true that Iohn ſhould not be <hi>that light,</hi> ſeeing Iohn is called, <hi>a burning, and a ſhining light.</hi> Iohn, 5, 35.</p>
               <p>Anſwere. Iohn was a light, the word was <hi>the light.</hi> The greeke wordes take away the difference. The word which is vſed of Iohn is <hi>Lychnos,</hi> as you ſay, a lynck, or torch, or great candle. Chriſt or the Word is the light, that is, the cheefe and principall.</p>
               <p>Iohn is a light enlightened and ſet on fire: Chriſt is light enlightening and kindeling. Chriſt is like the ſunne: Iohn like the Moone reflecting the ſunnes light.</p>
               <p>Iohn was light by office, and in meaſure: the Word is light naturally, and infinitely.</p>
               <p>But ſome man may ſay, who doubteth of the difference betweene Iohn and Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Anſwere: The Iewes; Iohn 1, Iohns diſciples, Herod, and others, and therefore leaſt any man ſhould thinke bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Iohn, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there was cauſe for, therefore the Euangeliſt thus ſpeaketh heere.</p>
               <p>Marke how the common people ouer-reach ſometimes in their iudgements of the Miniſters.</p>
               <p>That it is not ſafe, to be carried away, with the bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1866:157"/>of the people.</p>
               <p>And in that that Iohn ſo ſpeaketh for Chriſt, we all ſhould learne, all that we can, to keepe and increaſe the authoritie of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The clauſe repeated is expounded before.</p>
               <p>Now follow thoſe thinges which are affirmed of Chriſt:
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋerſe, </seg>9</label> The firſt whereof is <hi>that he was the true light.</hi> He that is, the Word, <hi>was</hi> as before: light is, as before: the hardneſſe is in the Word <hi>true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True is firſt contrarie to falſe or counterfeit. Some thinges ſeeme to haue light, as fiſhbones and rotten wood in the night, and yet haue none, Chriſt was not ſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is oppoſed to ſhaddow: as the lawe was by Moſes: but grace and truth by Chriſt: truth, that is, that which was foreſhaddowed in the lawe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, true is as much as naturall, not made &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In euery of theſe ſences may the Word be ſayd to be the true light: but beſides I think the meaning is as Iohn 15, 1, wherein Chriſt is called the true vine, that is, I take it, the moſt excellent vine. So heere true light, moſt excellent light.</p>
               <p>From him therefore ſhould we fetch light of doctrine, of liuing, of comfort, all which ſhould be as deere vnto vs as the light is or can be.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing affirmed of Chriſt, is that <hi>he lightneth euery man which commeth into the world.</hi> Where is ſet downe, what he doth, and to whom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He inlightneth,</hi> that is as we heard before, with naturall light: though other be in Chriſt. The ſunne communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not all his light to the Moone, no more doth Chriſt to man.</p>
               <p>Remember by this that naturall light is the gifte of God, and that therefore it ſhould be vſed to the ſetting forth of the glory of God.</p>
               <p>He doth this to euery one that commeth into the world: that is, to euery Mothers-Child which is borne into the world: this muſt be vnderſtood of the gifte of light, not of
<pb facs="tcp:1866:158"/>the vſe of light, which infants and Idiots haue not, though they haue the gift.</p>
               <p>The third thing ſaid of the VVord, is, that <hi>it was in the world.</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋerſe, </seg>10</label> Where we may conſider what it is, and how it is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and reſtrained.</p>
               <p>That which is ſaid, is, <hi>that he was.</hi> The limitation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, is the place, <hi>in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>was</hi> doth not onely ſignifie diuine exiſtence &amp; bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ſeeing the diuine beeing is euery where, it noteth the preſence thereof, and that euen in reſpect of time, for though indeede the VVord were before, and ſhall be after time, yet heere it is declared, that hee was from the vvorld created to Chriſt incarnate.</p>
               <p>There be foure degrees of the preſence of the Word to a creature.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the moſt wonderfull of all, when the Word maketh one perſon with a creature, as in the hypoſtaticall vnion of the two natures in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the preſence of glory, whereby the Word is preſent to the bleſſed Angels and Saints, in glory in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
               <p>The third is the preſence of grace, whereby he is preſent to the elect &amp; called in this life, by his eſpeciall ſauing grace and fauour.</p>
               <p>The fourth is the preſence of power, whereby he is with euery creature, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the higheſt heauen to the loweſt earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>World,</hi> doth heere ſignifie all the creatures together, and euery ſpeciall thereof.</p>
               <p>A queſtion may be: In what ſence of the foure the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence heere meant, is to be taken?</p>
               <p>Aun. It may be true in any of the three laſt, yet it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant of the fourth and laſt of all.</p>
               <p>For indeede the Word is preſent to euery creature, and ſo as that by the reaſonable creature, hee might be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be preſent.</p>
               <p>The VVord is preſent,</p>

               <p>All this which Iohn writeth of the Word for his time, is true in ours, and rather more then leſſe.</p>

               <p n="4">4 The VVord ruling the world, it cannot be choſen, but all ſhall be to the good of ſuch as truſt in the VVord.</p>

               <p>The fourth thing ſaid of the Word, is that <hi>the world was made by him.</hi>

               <p>Faith hath eſpeciall place heere, as beeing a thing verie hard to be belieued, &amp; beeing belieued is of very great vſe.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:159"/>
               <p> It appeareth that it is hard to belieue, for that Ariſtotle a notable man for naturall wit, could not be perſwaded that God ſhould make the world.</p>
               <p>The Arrians could not be perſwaded, that the perſon of the Word did make the world.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this being belieued is manifeſt: for that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer belieueth this, cannot but be perſwaded of the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie of the Word. For he who maketh all things of nothing, can doe any thing: 1 Can ſaue vs, 2 Heare our prayers, 3 Deliuer vs out of our croſſes: 4 Turne all things to our good.</p>
               <p>If any man deſire to know the will of this Word, let him looke to his incarnation.</p>
               <p>For as our creation putteth vs in minde of the VVordes power, ſo his incarnation putteth vs in minde of his good will.</p>
               <p>The fift thing ſaid of the Word, is <hi>that the world knew him not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereby is ſhewen, what reckoning there was of him: and heere wee may conſider whereby they were carried in not regarding the Word, and that is, <hi>by not knowing of him.</hi> Secondly, who were thus carried, &amp; they are ſaid to be <hi>the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This not knowing, is noted, though not named as a fault: for cleering whereof we muſt remember, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is either negatiue, or priuatiue.</p>
               <p>Negatiue not knowing is that, whereby one is ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as that it concerneth him not to know: as for mee to be ignorant what the counſel laſt deliberated of, what God hath decreed touching ſuch and ſuch a man.</p>
               <p>Priuate, is when one is ignorant of that which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him, and that which he ought to know. The which is noted heere in this place.</p>
               <p>For otherwiſe Chriſt according to his humane nature knoweth not the end of the world: knew not that the Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree had no fruite of it, &amp;c, ſo are the Saints ignorant of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie matters. All knowledge heere is in part, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:1866:159"/>
               <p> Now iuſtly is this priuatiue ignorance blamed. For that one ought to know the Word.</p>

               <p n="2">2 Of knowing whom we haue many meanes.</p>
               <p n="3">3 For that this ignorance is neuer alone, but hath vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, diſobedience, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>They who are carried away with this ignorance, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnder the name of <hi>the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>World doth not heere ſignifie (as before) for all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ioyntly or ſeuerally, for ſome part of the world cannot know, as vnreaſonable creatures, &amp; therefore muſt not be blamed for ignorance.</p>
               <p>The world therefore heere is a part of the world, wicked, vnrepentant, reprobate parties, for whom Chriſt prayeth not, Ioh, 17, 9, in which ſence the deuill is ſaid to be <hi>Prince of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed wicked men are thus termed, for that they are many, and the greateſt part of the world, and hurt the whole world. As Adam and Euah, and in the time of the flood.</p>
               <p>VVhereby by the way wee had neede to take heede of wicked men.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Marke then from both theſe put together the eſtate of moſt people in the world. They know not the Word, and whatſoeuer other things they know (as they may many) yet are they of no worth.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Ignorance of the VVord is a ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It is neuer alone.</p>

               <p>The ſixt thing ſpoken of the Word,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe. </seg>11</label> is <hi>that he came to his owne:</hi> wherein is a behauiour of this Word, in an action, and ſhewing whereto this action was.</p>
               <p>This action is, <hi>hee came.</hi> This is not meant of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head onely, for that beeing preſent euery where, cannot be
<pb facs="tcp:1866:160"/>ſaid to come.</p>
               <p>This is therefore in reſpect of the Words beeing made fleſh, by occaſion whereof he was not onely in the world, but preached, wrought miracles, liued &amp; died among his.</p>
               <p n="1">1 So as that if we would looke for the Word, wee ſhould ſeeke him in this his comming.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Where theſe are, there is the Word, ſo as theſe ought to be made of.</p>
               <p>This action was <hi>to his owne,</hi> not onely all creatures in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, but ſpeciall ſome things, as Iudea, Ieruſalem, the Temple, all which in ſpeciall ſort were Gods.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Wee may ſee heere that the Iewes haue the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, ſo as that refuſing, theyr condemnation is the iuſter.</p>
               <p n="2">2 God is marueilous kind comming thus to tender him ſelfe, ſo as if we be not ſaued, the fault is ours, what could God doe more?</p>
               <p n="3">3 God ſhewing more fauours, looketh for more duties. <hi>If I had not come</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>they had had no ſinne:</hi> that is, not ſo great.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If Chriſt thus offer himſelfe, why ſhould not we offer vp our ſelues to him, &amp; one to another in all good we can.</p>
               <p>The ſeauenth thing ſaid, is <hi>that his owne receiued him not.</hi> Where is ſhowed the behauior of men toward him, as their reckoning of him before.</p>
               <p>Heere are perſons, and behauiour. The perſons, <hi>his owne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The word in Engliſh, is the ſame with <hi>owne</hi> before: but in Greeke they differ. The former is Neuter, this Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line. The former noted things: this noteth perſons.</p>
               <p>Theſe parties are ſuch, whom God after a ſpeciall ſort had made his, as his peculiar people. They were the Iewes, whoſe prerogatiues are. Rom, 3, 2, that to them were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the oracles of God. Looke 9, Rom, 4, and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Euery of theſe is moſt excellent.</p>
               <p n="2">2 We now haue them as well as they.</p>
               <p n="3">3 They alone are not ſufficient; for the Iewes had them and receiued not Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:1866:160"/>
               <p> But heere a queſtion may be, whether but ſome, or none receiued the word?</p>
               <p>Aun. Some did receiue, all did not, whom it concerned, and who had meanes.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Where we may ſee, that howſoeuer that the Goſpell hath not the full fruite we could wiſh, yet ſome it hath.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That Chriſt, though hee were not receiued, beeing in his calling, gaue not ouer.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Though the vvorld marke not who receiueth the vvord, yet God doth.</p>
               <p>Theyr behauiour is, <hi>that they receiued him not.</hi> It is the neglect of duty.</p>
               <p>VVe may conſider toward whom this was, and what the fault was.</p>
               <p>It was toward the VVord, in his doctrine, his perſon, his office, his members, miniſters or profeſſors, all &amp; euery whereof we ought to receiue.</p>
               <p>The fault is <hi>not receiuing.</hi> This not receiuing, is refuſing of a thing proffered and tendered, which in ſuch a caſe as this cannot chooſe but be a grieuous ſin: ſo as Chriſt bid his Apoſtle in the like, to ſhake off the duſt of theyr feete for a witneſſe.</p>
               <p>The Iewes no doubt thought, that they did not offend this way; ſo as that we may ſee into how grieuous a ſinne a man may fall before euer he be aware.</p>
               <p>This receiuing is as the thing bodily, ſpiritually. Chriſt is both man and God, and muſt be receiued both waies, ſo as that they offend, who giue not Chriſt the beſt outward entertainement they can.</p>
               <p>Much more they who doe not 1 know, 2, acknowledge, 3 loue, 4 belieue, 5 obey Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now if Chriſt the King of heauen and earth, was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, why ſhould we thinke much if we be not?</p>
               <p>The eyght thing ſaid of the VVord, is <hi>whoſoeuer,</hi>

               <p>He giueth prerogatiue <hi>to be the ſonnes of God to ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb facs="tcp:1866:161"/>him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are noted by two markes, of fayth and regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>In that which he doth, we may marke what it is called, who doth it, and the thing done.</p>
               <p>It is called a gift, in that it is ſayd, <hi>he giueth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Giuing is free beſtowing of property, this is free, elſe were it deſert, or bargaine, or ſome ſuch.</p>
               <p>And indeed Chriſt was giuen to vs. Eſay, 9, 6. Iohn, 3, 16.</p>
               <p>But it may be obiected, that it is a ranſome or purchaſe.</p>
               <p>Anſwere. As it is from Chriſt to God the father, ſo it is a ranſome, but from the Father, and Chriſt to vs, a free gift.</p>
               <p>So as that there is nothing in our ſelues to procure this, nor keepe it, but all is fauour, which wanting we muſt pray for, hauing, we muſt prayſe God.</p>
               <p>He that doth this, is the Word.</p>
               <p>It may be obiected that euery good gift, is from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights, and ſo from the Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Father,</hi> Iames 1, 17, is a name common to the three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But putcaſe it be for the firſt perſon, the Father giueth all to the Sonne: whereupon we may ſee that the Sonne is God, in that he can make ſonnes of God, and this of being a child of God, cannot but be an excellent fauour, in that the whole Trinity giueth it.</p>
               <p>The thing done followeth, <hi>prerogatiue to be the ſonnes of God:</hi> wherein is the kind of the thing, and the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The kind, <hi>to be the ſonnes of God,</hi> commendation, <hi>preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Word tranſlated, <hi>ſonnes,</hi> were better children as it ſignifieth, ſo as that ignorant people, might not be hindred of their comfort intended heere, being of womans ſex.</p>
               <p>Theſe children are ſayd to be <hi>of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Child of God, is either by nature, or fauour.</p>
               <p>By nature, as the Word and Chriſt, nothing elſe.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:1866:161"/>
               <p> It may be obiected, 2 Peter, 1, 4, <hi>that we ſhould be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the diuine nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwer: nature doth ſignifie qualities and properties flowing from the diuine nature, not the eſſence it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>It is not meant therefore heere, Children by nature.</p>
               <p>By fauour are Angels or mankind.</p>
               <p>We neuer ſhalbe Angels, for we ſhall haue our ſoules at the laſt reſurrection ioyned to our bodyes, Angels are ſpirits.</p>
               <p>We ſhalbe like Angels for immortality, needing no bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinges, being in the preſence of God, otherwiſe not.</p>
               <p>Mankind, or men and women, may be the Children of God by creation, or generation, adoption, regeneration, imitation.</p>
               <p>By creation, as Adam and Eue, whom God himſelfe immediatly made.</p>
               <p>By generation, as all other men and women.</p>
               <p>Adoption, by being made a Child after one is not by nature.</p>
               <p>Regeneration, when the beginning of heauenly life, is wrought in a party.</p>
               <p>Imitation, when one indeauoureth to be like God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of his image.</p>
               <p>Creation is not heere vnderſtood. For ſo are all creatures after a ſort the children of God: and heere the Euangeliſt ſetteth out an eſpeciall fauour.</p>
               <p>The other three ſortes are true: but yet adoption is cheefely meant, whereof ſo much is mentioned in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and is the forerunning cauſe of the other two folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>A doption is a word taken from the ciuill lawe.</p>
               <p>Heere it ſignifieth Gods fauour to ſome of Adams poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, whereby he taketh them to himſelfe in ſpeciall ſort, giuing them the rites and dues of children.</p>
               <p>Hence commeth the <hi>houſehold of faith,</hi> Galat: 6, 10, the father-hood, Ephe: 3.</p>
               <p>For better knowing heereof, we may conſider the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
<pb facs="tcp:1866:162"/>gotten by this adoption, and the properties thereof.</p>

               <p>Theſe to whom, are ſet out by their duty, of <hi>receiuing him:</hi> &amp; their generality <hi>as many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The duty we haue knowen before: heere it is ſet,</p>
               <p n="1">1 As neceſſary, as no way to be the children of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, of what condition ſoeuer one be.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Noting the tyme of receiuing him, to wit, when he came among them; and proffered himſelfe vnto them. So that though we haue purpoſe to receiue him, and doe not when he offereth, we are neuer the neerer, when once the doore is ſhut: looke, Luke, 13, 25. Mathew, 25, 10.</p>
               <p>The generality ſhutteth out no receiuer, neither in the manner of receiuing, nor in the meaſure, nor in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the receiuer.</p>
               <p>Some cannot receiue Chriſt, euery way outwardly: though it be but with a cup of cold water, they ſhall not looſe their reward.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:163"/>
               <p> Some receiue him with ſmall knowledge, weake fayth; they are children if they will grow, and continue.</p>
               <p>Some are receiuers in many and great croſſes, yet vvill theyr beeing children, leſſen and eaſe their croſſes.</p>
               <p>Now then, ſeeing that receiuers of the Word haue ſuch fauours, who would not receiue?</p>
               <p>Or ſeeing that the Word doth ſo think of receiuers, why ſhould not we make great account of them?</p>
               <p>But heere it may be demaunded, 1 Is our receiuing the Word, a cauſe of our beeing the children of God?</p>
               <p>Aun. No: wee are children adopted in Chriſt. It is no working cauſe with God, it onely declareth vnto me.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Is our receiuing before our beeing children?</p>
               <p>Neither. In order is firſt beeing a child, then followeth receiuing, though ſometimes for time they goe together.</p>
               <p n="3">3 What then is the meaning heereof?</p>
               <p>Aun. The Euangeliſt writeth to young and new recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, who were willing indeede to receiue, but preſently ſaw nothing but croſſes and calamities: hee therefore wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to know theyr eſtate though nothing, yet that they are the children of God: whereuppon Paule prayeth for the Epheſians, 1, chap, 18 verſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1 By this Chriſtians ſhould learne not to miſlike theyr preſent eſtate for croſſes, but to ſearch into it, &amp; they ſhall find matter of great comfort.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That neuer any ſauing grace is alone, receiuing is with adoption, ſo as that we finding out one ſauing grace in our ſelues, we may be ſure that we haue more.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Adoption is in the beginning of all ſauing graces.</p>
               <p n="4">4 We may iudge of our adoption, by our receiuing the Word.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the noting of theſe parties: 1 by theyr beliefe, and wherein is the action, or dutie, and obiect.</p>
               <p>Action or dutie is <hi>belieuing,</hi> whereof wee haue ſpoken in another place.</p>

               <p>Now followeth whence they are borne, to wit, <hi>they are borne of God,</hi> where firſt, we muſt a little open the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> is eſſentially, Father, as 1, Peter 1, 3, the Sonne, as 1, Iohn, 12, the holy Ghoſt, as Iohn 3, 3, 5, for the workes of the Trinity, to the creature, are ioynt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of,</hi> in greeke <hi>en,</hi> vſually ſignifieth matter, heere it doth not ſo, but the efficient, or firſt worker. In deed naturall parents are ſo efficient, as of their matter we came, ſo is it not in our ſpirituall begetting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Borne:</hi> ſhould better be, begotten, to expreſſe the greeke word, and the thing heere meant.</p>
               <p>The mother properly beareth, heere God is as a father who begetteth: ſo that the meaning is, the whole holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, worketh in vs this change.</p>
               <p>This being borne, is the ſame with being the child of God, ſaue that there is ſignified one kind of being child, to wit, by adoption, heare by regeneration, there title, heere poſſeſſion as it were in part.</p>
               <p>To better vnderſtanding heereof, we may conſider the thing, the Author: the thing, <hi>being begotten;</hi> and this in the neceſſity of it, and in the nature.</p>
               <p>The neceſſity is ſuch as that the Euangeliſt noteth it, not onely to be commendable preſent, but neceſſary, ſo as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it we ſhall neuer well entertaine the Word. Looke. Ioh: 3, 3, 5, 7. So as vnleſſe we become as litle children, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the kingdome of heauen.</p>
               <p>The nature is not a like vnderſtood of all, ſome take it for that which is called ſanctification, others for the whole worke of grace, with whom I ioyne. And as it is called re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation or begetting, ſo is it like thereunto: ſaue that generation produceth ſubſtance, this doth produce onely qualities, and not all, not powers, but habits, reſtoring to the power integrity, with ready applycation, to the firſt and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1866:164"/>proper obiect.</p>
               <p>Chriſt defineth it, Iohn, 3, 3, <hi>to be borne, begotten againe: the kind of it, birth, begetting, the property of it, againe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Birth or begetting</hi> in this kind, hath infuſion of life this is called ſeed of God, 1, Iohn, 3, 9, to wit the gift of the holy ghoſt, like naturall heat, this continueth as long as ſpirituall life continueth.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Diffuſion of it ouer the whole man, powers, parts, practiſes, the counter-poyſon of originall ſin.</p>
               <p>The property <hi>againe,</hi> not to the ſame life as Nicodemus thought, but to another, which is called the life of God, Chriſt, the inner man the new man. And is.</p>
               <p>When a man in any life naturall, ciuill, houſhold, ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, ſociall, pleaſeth God.</p>
               <p n="1">1 When is that? 1, when he is quickning his faith, and repentance.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Hath direction for euery particular.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Doth euery thing thereafter in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Where marke, that the life of the regenerate, and vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, may be in the ſame things.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That regeneration ſtretcheth to the whole man.</p>
               <p>Que. But it may be demanded: Is not one regenerate partaker of naturall birth?</p>
               <p>Aun. Yes, but ſo as that which he receiueth from nature, is ordered by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>By this it may appeare, that all are not regenerate, and that it is hard to be regenerate.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the thing. The Author followeth. <hi>God:</hi> and God only. For there is no begetting, but of the fleſh, or God, that which is of the fleſh, is fleſh.</p>
               <p>Now indeed though this new birth be principally of God, yet are there vnder ſeruing cauſes; whereof for all that none haue power to worke of themſelues.</p>
               <p>Obiect. Paule ſayth, he begat the Corinthians, 1, Cor, 4, 15, and traueled in birth of the Galathians, 4, Galat, 19: was Tymotheus, and Tyrus his father.</p>
               <p>Sol. Miniſterially: not that Paule or Apollos, could doe
<pb facs="tcp:1866:165"/>any thing of themſelues. God gaue the increaſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Obiect. Chriſt ſayth, 3. Iohn, 5, we muſt be borne of water, and the holy ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Solu. Water there doth but expound the worke of the holy Ghoſt; for as water ſoftneth and cleanſeth: ſo muſt euery one be, who is borne againe.</p>
               <p>In the ſame is it ſayd we muſt be baptiſed, with the holy Ghoſt, and fire, that is, the holy Ghoſt working like fire, eating out droſſe, and enkindling burning loue of all good things.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Obiect. It is ſayd Tytus, 3, 5. Ephe: 5, 26, that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme regenerateth.</p>
               <p>Solu. It confirmeth to the due receiuer, regeneration, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els.</p>
               <p>So then God alone only worketh effectually, and yet vſeth vnder meanes, as that we muſt neither neglect meanes, nor truſt alone vnto them.</p>
               <p>Queſtion, why are men in this kind, ſayd to be borne of God, as though they were not ſo in nature likewiſe?</p>
               <p>Anſwer, for that this new birth is ſo excellent, as that in compariſon of the former, it may ſeeme to be the only.</p>
               <p>Queſtion: whether is faith before regeneration, for heere it is placed before it?</p>
               <p>Anſwer: faith is in a party, before he can know that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is regenerated. One may be regenerat before he hath fayth, as infants.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the meaning: the vſe followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Seeing none receiue the Word, and ſo are not the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of God, but ſuch as are begotten of God, it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to indeauour, after this new begetting, and for that none beget themſelues, it will be the ſafeſt to examin, whether we be begotten, yea or no.</p>
               <p>That ſhall we find by theſe notes.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Grace imitateth nature, which firſt maketh vital, then others parts.</p>
               <p>The vital part of a Chriſtian is Chriſt, which when it is formed in vs, ſheweth our new begetting. Galath: 4, 19,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1866:165"/>1, Iohn, 5, 12, he therfore that hath not knowledge of him, faith in him, &amp;c. may ſuſpect himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The party begotten a new, vſeth all thinges of outward life, by direction of Gods word, to the glory of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 He ſinneth not, 1, Iohn, 3, 9, that is, before he ſinnneth, he purpoſeth not ſo to doe, after he hath ſinned, he will not continue therein.</p>
               <p n="4">4 He is willing to helpe others to be regenerate.</p>
               <p n="5">5 He groweth by nouriſhment of the Word, exerciſes actiue, paſſiue.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Motion bewrayeth life, ſpirituall motion is of the heart in prayer.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Sence of heauenly things, with ability to put difference betweene them, to take liking of them, and affect them.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Hatred of him becauſe it is ſin, in our ſelues, euen the ſecreteſt.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Loue of the bretheren.</p>
               <p>Secondly, marke that this heere is begetting, we are not perfected, nor ſhalbe heere, only we muſt labor thereto, and neuer giue ouer though we come ſhort.</p>
               <p>Thus much for this eight ſaying, touching the Word, and his God-head: now followeth his man-hood in the fourteenth verſe; wherein we may conſider the ioyning of it to the former, and as it is in it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>It is ioyned to the former, by this particle, <hi>and:</hi> which ſheweth that this truth heere mentioned, is as neceſſary as the former.</p>
               <p>In it ſelfe, it containeth 4 ſpeeches.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The firſt, <hi>the Word was made fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 The ſecond, <hi>the Word dwelt among vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 The third, <hi>we ſawe the glory thereof, as the glory of the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten of the father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 The fourth, <hi>he was full of grace and truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt, let vs conſider the meaning, the reaſon, the vſe.</p>
               <p>The meaning will ariſe, from the words and phraſe, well vnderſtood.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:166"/>
               <p> The Word is God, as before, contrary to Arrius, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heretiques, who take Chriſt but for a bare man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Was,</hi> that is, ſo was as now is, and for euer ſhall continue.</p>
               <p>Obiect. It may be obiected that he died, and ſo the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may ſeeme to be diſſolued.</p>
               <p>Solu. No, for though the ſoule and body were parted for a time, yet neither was ſeuered from the God-head.</p>
               <p>So he was made as not changed, the God-head was not turned into the Man-hood.</p>
               <p>As not beeing one mixed of the Manhood, and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head together, as when bread is made of water &amp; meale.</p>
               <p>But by aſſuming or taking the Manhood to God.</p>
               <p>So as that Neſtorius deuiding the perſons, and Eutiches confounding the natures, doe erre.</p>
               <p>Obiect. But it may be doubted whether there ſhould not thus be two perſons?</p>
               <p>Solu. No, but one, for the Manhood hath no beeing, nor neuer had of or in it ſelfe, but in the Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fleſh</hi> doth heere ſignifie man, as all <hi>fleſh,</hi> that is, mankind is <hi>graſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now man is body and ſoule.</p>
               <p>Body ſenſible, naturall, this Chriſt had, not heauenlie, imaginary, phantaſticall.</p>
               <p>Soule likewiſe Chriſt had, when he ſaid, <hi>My ſoule is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie to the death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neyther doth he ſaue that which hee doth not take.</p>
               <p>So as that Apollinaris erreth, who ſaith the God-head was in ſtead of a ſoule.</p>
               <p>By this that Chriſt had a ſoule, it appeareth that hee had two wills, not contrary: one of the God-head, the other of the Manhood.</p>
               <p>Otherwiſe then the Monothelites erroniouſly teach.</p>
               <p>Ob. But it may be ſaid: whence had Chriſt this fleſh?</p>
               <p>Sol. His body he had of the ſubſtance of the Virgin, his ſoule was created of nothing in the wombe of the virgin.</p>
               <p>Ob. The virgin was conceiued in ſin, how then could Chriſt his body be free there-from?</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:1866:166"/>
               <p> Solu. The holy Ghoſt who wrought the conception of Chriſt, did clenſe that part of the virgin from all ſin.</p>
               <p>Que. When was he thus made fleſh?</p>
               <p>Aun. Immediatly when the virgin had conſented to the meſſage of the Angell, and ſaid, <hi>Be it vnto mee according to thy word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Que. How could the body be ioyned to God?</p>
               <p>Aun. By the ſoule.</p>
               <p>This is the meaning. The reaſon why this was doone in time, is, for that it was ordained before all time.</p>
               <p>Que. Why did God ordaine this meanes?</p>
               <p>Aun. Not for that hee could not haue appointed ſome other, but for that this ſeemed beſt to him, for to manifeſt his mercie, and iuſtice: by his mercy in giuing his Sonne, his iuſtice, in not ſparing him: his iuſtice, that man offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſhould ſatisfie in dooing and ſuffering, his mercy in procuring, that God ſhould enable the Man-hood ſo to do and ſuffer.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The vſe is manifold. Firſt to teach vs the loue of God, and care for our ſaluation: for hee giuing ſuch a notable meanes, how can we doubt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Conſider our honour and prerogatiue, to be as it were the brothers of Chriſt. Heb, 2, 11.</p>

               <p n="4">4 Know that Chriſt can haue compaſſion of vs, hauing had experience of our infirmities. Heb, 2, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſpeech followeth. Wherein we may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the meaning, the vſe.</p>
               <p>For the meaning, know firſt, that the Word made fleſh muſt be repeated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dwelling</hi> doth ſignifie, as in a Tent or boothe, whereby the ſickleneſſe, and vncertaintie of our life is implied, and where as it is ſaid <hi>he dwelt,</hi> the meaning is, hee dooth not ſo now in perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Among vs,</hi> is not onely in our nature, but in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: <hi>our,</hi> who are Apoſtles of Ieruſalem, of Iudea.</p>

               <p n="2">2 In our conuerſing, to take occaſion of dooing all the good we can.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Know that as Chriſt dwelling among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; they not profiting, their ſinne was the greater: ſo will it be with vs, or any, amongſt whom Chriſt any way or while dwelleth.</p>
               <p>The third ſpeech followeth, <hi>And we ſaw, &amp;c.</hi> wherein is ſet downe what is ſaid of Chriſt, and how it is confimed.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid of him, that he had glory, as of the onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Father. It is confirmed in that he ſaith, <hi>we ſaw it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which is ſaid of Chriſt, hath the bare thing, or the meaſure, the bare thing is <hi>glory,</hi> the meaſure in the reſt.</p>
               <p>Glory to ſpeake properly, doth ſignifie naturall bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as the glory of the ſunne, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now for that the greater the brightneſſe is, the more is the excellencie of the thing whence it commeth, therefore glory doth ſignfie bewrayed excellencie, &amp; heere bewrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diuine excellencie, which Chriſt had, 17, Iohn 5, ſo as that Iohns meaning is, we ſaw him to be God, &amp; eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it.</p>
               <p>The meaſure is, of <hi>an onely ſonne of a Father.</hi> Father doth heere ſignifie God the Father, <hi>of,</hi> diſtinction of perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Father, and the onely begotten.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Onely begotten,</hi> who is to haue all that which the Father hath.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is ſometimes called the onely begotten ſonne of GOD, in reſpect of the diuine nature, which of all Gods ſonnes he onely hath. Others are ſonnes by adoption &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, firſt borne, in reſpect of the humane nature wherein he excelleth all other.</p>
               <p>Ob. But how doth this (will ſome ſay) increaſe the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie?</p>
               <p>Solu. The Fathers glory is infinite, the Sonnes is equall: therefore it is very great.</p>
               <p>Beſides, this glory is increaſed by the particle <hi>as,</hi> which
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1866:167"/>ſignifieth truly not onely likeneſſe, ſo elſe where.</p>
               <p>It appeareth from hence, 1 That the VVord is GOD, 2 That he is a perſon diſtinct from the Father, 3 That hee is equall to the Father.</p>
               <p>Now followeth how it is confirmed, <hi>we ſaw,</hi> that is, often and wiſtly looked vpon. VVee who conuerſed with him, to whom God gaue eyes to ſee. All did not perceiue this.</p>
               <p>Que. How could they perceiue it?</p>
               <p>Aun. By his wonderfull works.</p>
               <p>See 1, that it is not ſufficient to be in meanes, vnleſſe God open the hart.</p>

               <p>Firſt, mention is made of Iohn, 1 for that hee was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied
<pb facs="tcp:1866:168"/>to come before Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 For that he was before Chriſt in time, in the fleſh.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Being to be witneſſe to Chriſt, it was meete his perſon ſhould be knowen, that the ſufficientneſſe of his witneſſe might appeare.</p>

               <p>Luke, 1, chap. 5, verſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing deliuered of Iohn, is his conception, 1, Luke: from the beginning of the 5 verſe, to the later end of the 25.</p>

               <p>Seuerally, the husband; and firſt from his kind of life, generally, that he was a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> 2, particularly, of the courſe of Abia: 3, by his name, 4, that he was married, 5, that to him this conception was foretold.</p>
               <p>The Wife, 1, by her ſtocke, that ſhe was of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Aaron, 2, by her name, ſhe was called Elizabet.</p>
               <p>The time was, <hi>In the daies of Herod, then King of Iudea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where we may conſider how the time is called, and how it is further made knowen.</p>
               <p>It is called in the Greeke <hi>daies:</hi> by an vſuall manner of ſpeaking in the ſcriptures, belonging to the Hebrew tongue, for that a day was the firſt difference of time.</p>
               <p n="1">1 To teach vs that time, and things in time, are but momentary, and but for a day.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:1866:168"/> 2 That good Gouernours raignes, are but in daies, ſo as that in them, we muſt not be ſecure.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That Tyrants ſhall no continue for euer, that we ſhould not be diſcouraged.</p>
               <p>Queſtion. But what ſpeciall time was this in?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. About the 31 or 32 of Herods raigne, when he grew to be moſt outragious, murdering Salomes husband, and ſonne, the 40 gentlemen, and their teachers, yea euen his owne ſonnes Ariſtobulus, &amp; Alexander, and a little after the Sanhedrim, and infants of Bethlehem.</p>
               <p>Queſtion, why is this time thus noted?</p>
               <p n="1">1 Anſwer, to teach vs firſt: that though tyrants rage ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo much, God will haue his Church and number.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That the godly will not giue ouer their profeſſion, for feare of Tyrants, but in corrupted and corrupting tymes, wilbe the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That God in ſuch diſordered times, taketh knowledge of ſuch as truly feare him, ſo as that they ſhould not be diſcouraged by any aduerſaries.</p>
               <p>This time is further ſet out, 1, by the perſon in it, and by his calling.</p>
               <p>The perſon is named <hi>Herod,</hi> his calling <hi>King:</hi> and that, <hi>of Iudea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were three Herods mentioned in ſcripture.</p>
               <p>One in the Acts 12, Herod Agrippa, I take it the graund child to this.</p>
               <p>Another, who cut of Iohn the Baptiſtes head, called Herod Antipas.</p>
               <p>The third, this: the ſonne of Antipater, by his fathers, and by his owne meanes, called the great for his victories, buildings of the Temple, Sebaſte, Amphitheatrum, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He is noted to be King: to put a difference betweene him, and other gouenours before him, for his father Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater, was but deputed by Caeſar. The Aſſamonaei, had not this title of King.</p>
               <p>Now this man the Senatours of Rome made King.</p>
               <p>Iudea, is oppoſed (I take it) to the territories of Samaria,
<pb facs="tcp:1866:169"/>and was the place of the viſible Church.</p>
               <p>Marke what greate places in the world, wicked men like Herod, may mount vnto, 1, ſo as that we need not enuy them, neither thinke theſe outward things the beſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Know that if vnder an euill Prince, Zachary and Elyſabeth were good, what ſhould we be in good lawes and Gouernours?</p>
               <p n="3">3 And ſeeing that Iudea came to Herods gouernment, let vs take heed, leaſt that by our ſinnes we procure the like iudgement to our ſelues, and if the ſame befall vs, let vs labour beforehand for ſo much grace, as may make vs hold out therein.</p>
               <p>Queſtion. But why is Herods being King mentioned?</p>
               <p>Anſwer. To ſhew that Iacobs prophecie, Geneſis, 49, 10, is fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Queſtion. Was not the ſcepter gone from Iuda in the Machabees time, who were of the Tribe of Leui?</p>
               <p>Aun. They were but keepers thereof in dangerous times.</p>
               <p>Againe, it is not meant (I take it) that the Gouernour ſhould alwayes be of Iuda, but that among the people of the Iewes, in this Herods time, who was the firſt king of Iudea, it was others.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Heere we ſee the certainty of things fortold in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That promiſes to the Church for outward things are not for euer.</p>
               <p n="3">3 This were enough to proue to a Iew that Chriſt were come.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the time: the next mentioned is the man, for his kind of life generally that he was a <hi>Prieſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Prieſt was as is diſcribed, 5, Heb, 1, and repreſented Chriſt.</p>
               <p>He was <hi>of the order of Aaron,</hi> this order ended when Chriſt dyed.</p>
               <p>Prieſts were not in that time contemptible, but of good regard ſucceeding into the roome of the duty of the eldeſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1866:169"/>ſonne: ſo was Aaron the elder brother, Prieſt.</p>
               <p>Queſt. Are there no Prieſts now?</p>
               <p>Aun. If you ſpeake of Prieſts vnproperly to offer ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſacrifices, all Chriſtians are Prieſts, but if you ſpeake properly, there are none ſince Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Queſt. What thinke you of the Prieſts of the Romiſh Church?</p>
               <p>Aun. As of Ierobohams Prieſts, they haue filled their owne hands, and haue no calling, and whereas they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be after the order of Melchiſedec, they ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnlearned and wicked, for there was no order of Prieſt-hood according to Melchiſedec: but as Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec is mentioned without father, mother, genealogy: ſo is Chriſt: againe, ſo to be, dooth properly belong vnto Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Know from all this there is no reconciliation without Chriſt, whom the Prieſt did repreſent.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That then Prieſt-hood was no diſgrace, why ſhould miniſtry now be?</p>
               <p n="3">3 Vſe wiſely the name of Prieſt, of <hi>Preſt,</hi> or <hi>Proeſtos,</hi> not of <hi>Sacerdos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 Since Zachary executed the Prieſts office, in ſuch times when he ſaw litle fruit, and might be diſcouraged, let vs all learne to keepe our ſtations, wherein we are ſet of God, going cheerfully on in our duties, committing ſucceſſe vnto God, though many diſcouragments incounter vs.</p>
               <p>Particularly, he was <hi>of the courſe of Abia.</hi> For better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding heereof, looke, 1, Chron: 24. Whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that Dauid ordained 24 courſes of Prieſts, euery one to ſerue his weeke or fortnight, as may appeare, 2, Chron: 23, 8.</p>
               <p>The courſe of Abia was the eight of thoſe, 24.</p>
               <p>Dauid diſtinguiſhed theſe thus, not only by his Princely authority, but in ſpired by the holy Ghoſt, being to giue his beſt directions to Salomon, who ſhould build the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whereto Gods ſolemne worſhip ſhould be tyed, after a long time it had beene in a flitting Tent or tabernacle.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:170"/>
               <p> Thus hee dooth, 1 That no Prieſt (though there were many) ſhould be idle.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That the burden beeing borne by courſe, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies lying vpon one, might be the better borne with lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger continuance.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That things beeing done by courſe, none might be grieued, troden downe too much, or grow inſolent, being lifted vp aboue his brethren, but all might be done louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and brotherly.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Kings may doe no more in Church matters, then they haue warrant for, by Gods word and Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2 No Miniſter in the Church ſhould be idle, but worke in due time.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It ſhould be prouided they might ſo worke, as that they might continue the longeſt for the moſt good of the Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4 There ſhould be no inordinate ſuperioritie among them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His name was Zachary,</hi> wherein we may conſider the very name, and why it is recorded ſo to be.</p>
               <p>Zachary ſignifieth remembring GOD. Some thinke it was he mentioned, Math, 23, 35, ſlaine betweene the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the Altar, but they haue no warrant ſo to think.</p>
               <p>Sure it is this name was well liked, for that the friendes would haue had Iohn to be thus called. It ſhall therefore concerne thoſe who giue names, to giue ſuch as may put in mind to the caller, called, or hearer ſome good.</p>
               <p>It is here recorded ſo to be. Firſt, becauſe there were but few at that time ſo godly. 2 To ſhew that God keepeth a record of his. 3 That we might haue them as Preſidents, whom we might follow, and be like.</p>
               <p>It followeth, <hi>that hee had a wife:</hi> which meaneth, that as himſelfe, ſo his wife was maintained by his Prieſts office, not onely ſo, but their whole charge.</p>
               <p>Que. It may be demaunded, whether it be not as lawful for ſuch as attend the word and Sacraments now, to haue wiues, as it was for the Prieſts?</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:1866:170"/>
               <p> Aun. Yes all alike, for that there is nothing againſt it in the word, but for it, as might be ſhewed, and cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the Papiſts themſelues: who teach that to forbid (as they ſpeake) Prieſtes marriage, is not diuine, but Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique, or Church-law.</p>
               <p>They know that none of vs now doe take the vow.</p>
               <p>Queſt. But what ſay you of their Prieſts, whether may they lawfully marry, or no?</p>
               <p>An. If they made a vow of ſingle life, and cannot keepe it, they ought to marry.</p>
               <p>But ſee their reaſons whereupon out of Scripture theyr Church inioyneth ſingle life.</p>
               <p n="1">1 They abuſe this very place, Luke, 1, 23, and 1, Chron, 24, for that they ſay when they miniſtred they were from their wiues. Aunſwere.

               <p>Generall iuſtice is heere meant. This may be conſidered as it is, by imputation, or renouation.</p>
               <p>Iuſtice by imputation, is when all Chriſtes righteouſnes is reckoned or imputed to one.</p>
               <p>Iuſtice by renouation, is when by the worke of the holie Ghoſt, one is renewed to doe the Law, this is commonlie called ſanctification.</p>

               <p>The further ſetting out of this their godlineſſe followeth, and is in expounding of the former, for in that they were ſayd to be iuſt, the meaning is, <hi>that they walked in all the

               </p>
               <p>In that they were ſayd <hi>to be iust before God:</hi> the meaning is, <hi>that they were without blame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former part expounding their iuſtice, is taken from their life led according to Gods word.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Learne that firſt mens eſtate muſt be iudged by their life.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Life muſt be ruled by Gods word.</p>
               <p>The expounding and making more playne their being iuſt, is from the framing of their life to Gods word; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we may ſee whereto they did conforme, &amp; in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>They did conforme their liues, to all the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ordinances of the Lord. The Lord is the true Iehoua.</p>
               <p>Commandements and ordinances are two names, which ſet out the word of God. Commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſignifie the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, ordinances the ceremoniall law.</p>
               <p>The ordinances are called in Greeke <hi>Dikaiomata,</hi> as you would ſay, righteouſneſſes, whereupon ſome gather, we may be iuſt before thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dikaiomata</hi> is the ſame Word which the 72 Interpreters in the old teſtament, put for <hi>Kukkim,</hi> which when men indeuour to keepe with the morrall law, good reaſon they ſhould be counted iuſt, but that none could fully keepe them, ſee Actes, 15, 10, where they are called a yoake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable.</p>
               <p>Now theſe commandements and ordinances are written, named, not ſome but all, and euery of them.</p>
               <p>Queſt. Can a man keepe all Gods commandements?</p>
               <p>Aun. Not of himſelfe, but in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>A man may be ſayd to keepe all, when Chriſt his keeping of all is imputed to him; when himſelfe is renewed to keepe all, as the Word requireth.</p>

               <p n="2">2 We muſt indeuour in all Gods commandements, not neglect the leaſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Greater duties muſt be done firſt, and with greater care.</p>

               <p>One liueth without reproofe, when after his effectuall calling, he cannot iuſtly be charged with any groſſe open ſin before, or of men.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:1866:174"/>of his ſinnes, and of his vnfained conueſion vnto God, and often to renue this his aſſurance. 2 To beware of ſin in reſpect of God, and his owne conſcience.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Through very hatred of ſin not to offend. 4 Not to fal again into the ſame offence. 5 To ſhun a mans proper faults wherevnto hee is moſt addicted. 6 No not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the leaſt of all. 7 In things lawfull which are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, not to be much conuerſant.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Not to intermedle with other mens matters: but look what he is called vnto which is needfull, that to doe. 9 To take heede of all appearance of euill. 10 Yea to auoyd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the occaſions of ſinne.</p>

               <p n="1">1 To ſift himſelfe whether hee hath not ſinned in ſome other kind, that he may ſeeke for pardon for it at the hands of God.</p>

               <p>Their croſſe is that <hi>they had no child: becauſe &amp;c,</hi> where is the cauſe, and continuance.</p>
               <p>This is noted as a croſſe comming from God, children are the good bleſſings of God, and euery thing that hath life, hath gift to bring forth it like.</p>
               <p>Children doth God promiſe and giue to Abraham and others as a fauour.</p>
               <p>Indeed the want of children doth not ſtraight way argue the anger of God, they are but a common bleſſing to the good and bad.</p>
               <p>Euen in this kinde, Zacharie and Eliſabet had more cauſe of griefe; others, though they had not many, yet might haue a ſonne, theſe had not ſo much as a daughter.</p>
               <p>Que. Why did God deale thus by them?</p>

<pb facs="tcp:1866:175"/>God doth inſflict. And ſhould beare them patiently.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Children are the fauour of God, &amp; the more the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo as they are too blame, who thinke them a charge, or beeing married, would haue none.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Gods children may want of the common fauours, as children, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4 In the croſſe God maketh them drinke deeper then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Others may haue ſonnes or daughters, theſe haue not ſo much as one daughter.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Yet marke they are righteous, and want nothing to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life: ſo good is God, though he depriue of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts.</p>
               <p n="6">6 As they want the comfort of good children, ſo are they free from paines, coſt, care, and haue not the griefe which commeth by euill children.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Men ſhould when they want children, or are vnder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny croſſe, know the thing they want is Gods gift, pray for it, vow it vp to God, if God ſhall giue it them, as Hanna did her Samuell.</p>
               <p>This is the croſſe: the cauſe followeth, <hi>becauſe that Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabet was barren,</hi> and heere is the perſon, and the thing: the perſon, <hi>Eliſabet,</hi> as before.</p>
               <p>The thing, <hi>that ſhe was barren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Barrenneſſe is naturall vnabilitie to conceiue.</p>
               <p>This is noted as a blemiſh in Eliſabet, not onely for that children are a benefit, but for that the Iewes were much gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to outward things, and that moſt of the Iewiſh vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were very fruitfull, and they were the more deſirous to beare, for that (as ſome thinke) euery of them looked to beare the Meſſias.</p>
               <p>Now this croſſe is the more grieuous, for that it croſſed them of one of their chiefe intents in vndertaking of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, namely children.</p>
               <p>And could not be but occaſion of griefe, between a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried couple.</p>
               <p>And yet this blemiſh was without any fault of Eliſabets, beeing in her by nature, or the worke of God.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:1866:175"/>
               <p> See 1 how it pleaſeth God, to let his children be vnder ſome reproch, and kind of infamie. Sure for their good, to make them walke humbly with theyr God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 God many times croſſeth a man in his good intents, &amp; deſires to teach vs wholy to reſigne our ſelues ouer vnto him.</p>
               <p n="3">3 As Zachary and Eliſabet for all the barrenneſſe and croſſe, continued their iuſtice amongſt men, and kindnes between themſelues: ſo muſt we in what domeſticall croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſoeuer.</p>
               <p n="4">4 It is a great comfort, howſoeuer we beare ſome blame, that the fault yet is not ours. Eliſabet had ſhame amongſt women that ſhe had no child, yet was it not her fault, but naturall barrenneſſe: the like will be a great comfort vnto vs in the like eſtate.</p>
               <p>The continuance remaineth: <hi>both were well striken in age,</hi> that is, this want of children continued, till they were well ſtriken in yeeres.</p>
               <p>Now ſure it is (no doubt) that they often prayed for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and might ſeeme now to be out of hope.</p>
               <p n="1">1 God is wont to hold his children long time vnder the croſſe, ſo as that they ought to prepare ſtrength to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue and hold out.</p>
               <p n="2">2 When Gods children pray for outward things, he doth not preſently giue them: the exerciſe of their faith, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing other ſpirituall things are better.</p>
               <p n="3">3 When things ſeeme paſt hope, God can worke.</p>
               <p>The fift thing particulerly ſet downe touching Zachary is,

               </p>
               <p>This latter ſtandeth firſt, and therefore will wee conſider of it firſt. It hath foure ſpeciall poynts in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That Zachary executed the prieſts office before god.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He did this as his courſe came in order.</p>
               <p n="3">3 There were certaine cuſtomes of the Prieſts office.</p>
               <p n="4">4 He did this by lot.</p>
               <p>The firſt hath what he did, and how.</p>
               <p>What, <hi>he executed the Priests office:</hi> how, <hi>before God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A prieſt as before, repreſenting Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Executing the office, is not onely to haue the credit and profit of the place, but to doe the dutie, how troubleſome ſoeuer it ſeeme.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Learne Gods goodneſſe to the Church, that euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſtes comming, hee left not the Church without inſtruction in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 We muſt be as ready to beare the burdens of duties, as to haue the credit and profits.</p>
               <p n="3">3 No trouble ſhould hinder vs from dooing our dutie.</p>
               <p n="4">4 This meſſage was brought to him, when he was in the duties of his calling, ſo as that it is good to attend on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Before God:</hi> as in the preſence of God, not onely as this was a religious dutie, but as of his calling.</p>
               <p n="1">1 God indeede is after a ſpeciall ſort preſent in Church aſſemblies, ſo as we ſhould with deſire reſort thether, and with reuerence continue there.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In any dutie of any calling, a man ſhould carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as to God.</p>
               <p>The ſecond poynt is, that he thus did, <hi>as his courſe came in order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of theſe courſes and order, looke verſe 5.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid <hi>his courſe,</hi> not that hee ruſhed into another mans courſe.</p>
               <p>Ioſephus writeth that in his time, the number of parties in ſome one of theſe courſes was 5000, ſo as though Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1866:176"/>had not executed this office, ſome other of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der likely might, or he might eaſily haue got ſome other, for conſideration to haue ſupplyed his roome. Greater is his commendation, that though theſe courſes had long agone been ordained, the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the duties was not neglected.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Learne not to intrude into another mans courſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 We muſt not as many doe, when many are ioyned in one duty, put it of to others. It is too true a ſaying, that which all men care for, no man careth for.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Yea we ſhould, all that we poſſibly could, doe our duties our ſelues.</p>
               <p n="4">4 In no caſe ſhould time continued, make duties diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Moſt probable it is, that Zachary in the time of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till his courſe came, he prepared himſelfe to be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter furniſhed, for the next time to doe his duty; ſo ſhould euery of vs.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The beſt preparation is, firſt by disburdning of the mynd of other thoughts.</p>
               <p n="2">2 By ſeeking to God for grace by prayer.</p>
               <p>The third poynt is: that he thus did,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋerſe, </seg>9</label> 
                  <hi>according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Prieſts office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the prieſts office, we haue heard before.</p>
               <p>Cuſtome, is often practiſe.</p>
               <p>Cuſtome is
<list>
                     <item>diuine, renewed by authority of God,</item>
                     <item>humane, renewed by authority of man.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Humane are then good, when not binding conſcience.</p>
               <p>They are to edification: comly without ſcandall.</p>
               <p>Both theſe no doubt Zachary obſerued.</p>
               <p>It was very much that cuſtome cauſed not, that Zachary did his duty with leſſe care, and conſcience.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Marke, firſt the beſt cuſtome is from God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Good men muſt keepe good cuſtomes of their places, being perſwaded of the lawfulneſſe of them in their heart, not giuing ſcandall to others.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Often doing a duty, ſhould not make vs doe it the more
<pb facs="tcp:1866:177"/>ſlightly.</p>
               <p>Therefore, let vs remember Gods commandement to doe it.</p>
               <p>The neceſſity we haue of doing it.</p>
               <p>The fourth poynt is, <hi>that he did thus by Lot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be demanded, whether he did the Prieſts office, according to the Lot that fell to Abia, or this of offering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, for ſome thinke the number of the Prieſts increaſing, and many duties being to be done, as offering the lambes in ſacryfice, looking to the lights, burning incenſe, &amp;c, all which one could not well doe; they caſt lots therefore who ſhould doe which, and to burne incenſe fell to Zacharias. This opinion is not much amiſſe, if any place of ſcripture would giue light vnto it.</p>
               <p>But yet I thinke the former is meant, 1, becauſe the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (that I know of) no where mentioneth the latter.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, the former is manifeſt, 1, Chron, 24, 7, 10, verſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Beſides the labour of al was not ſo much, but one might well doe all, hauing helpe of the Leuits, as they were wont to haue.</p>
               <p>A lot it is certaine was vſed.</p>
               <p>I omit to ſpeake of the manner of caſting lots.</p>
               <p>The word of God teacheth that they were neuer vſed: 1. But in very great matters, ſuch as were godly. Looke Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit, 16, 8, Ioſhua, 7, 16, Acts, 1, 26.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To find out immediatly the will of God. Prouerbs, 16, 33.</p>
               <p n="3">3 With great reuerence, hauing prayer before, Acts, 1, 24, 26.</p>
               <p>Indeed the ſouldiers caſt lots for Chriſtes garment, Ioh: 19, 24.</p>
               <p>Hence ſome godly learned haue gathered, that it is not ſeemly for a Chriſtian to vſe lots in ſport.</p>
               <p>For better vnderſtanding: know that lots are of 4 ſorts.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Diuine, appoynted and vſed by God, theſe are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of all.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:1866:177"/> 2 For diabolicall diuination, as Haman; theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of all.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Politicall for choiſe of Magiſtrats, in caſes of war, theſe are tollerated.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Ludicrous for ſport, theſe are called into queſtion of moſt, let vs try whether they be lawfull, yea or no.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Hierom ſaith: a lot is hidden and incomprehenſible predeſtination, ruled by God, who dare play with this?</p>
               <p n="2">2 There cannot be ſhewed any warrant for it in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by precept, practiſe, generall, ſpeciall, expreſſe, or implyed, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The ſcripture noteth wicked men to haue vſed them ſo: Pſal, 22, 18, Iohn, 19, 24.</p>
               <p n="4">4 I ſee not but that a man may as well ieſt with the word, ſacraments, oaths, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Gods prouidence ruleth in all things, and therefore it may be ſayd other exerciſes ſhould by this reaſon be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. Indeed Gods prouidence doth rule euery where, but in the moſt though, by meanes, but in a lot immediate. Now to dally with that is dangerous and vnmeete. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: we all liue by the gouernment of Queene, and Counſaile, ſhould euery child, and wanton doe well, who would call the Prince &amp; counſaile perſonally to determine their ſports.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Learned men hold then are lots only lawfull, when they are neceſſary: what neceſſity is there for play?</p>
               <p n="7">7 The difference betweene learned men, cannot but make men doubt whether it be lawfull, yea or no: then to vſe them doubtingly is ſin.</p>
               <p>Other reaſons might be brought.</p>
               <p>Of this kind are dice, cards, tables, drawing of cuts, lotteries, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">1 We are to be deſired to forbeare them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 We muſt vſe Gods ordinances with reuerence.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And as the lot determined the will of God, we muſt labour in all our affaires to be perſwaded thereof towards vs.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Burning incenſe:</hi> is to make (as we ſpeake) perfume by burning, this was according to Gods commandement. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, 30, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>There are two incenſe <hi>burnings</hi> mentioned in ſcriptures, commended by God.</p>
               <p>One daily by the ordinary Prieſts, interceſſory; Exod, 30, 8, 10.</p>
               <p>The other yearely the tenth day of the ſeauenth month, by the high Prieſt, propitiatory with blood. Leuit: 16, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Theſe are diſtinct, and therefore the quotation in our Bibles of the 30 Exod, and 16 Leuit: to this place are not fit.</p>
               <p>It may be demanded wether of theſe two incenſe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings is heere meant.</p>
               <p>Some ſay the later, and therefore alſo iudge that Zachary was the high Prieſt, vnſoundly.</p>
               <p n="1">1 For Luke calleth him barely the Prieſt not high, which he would not haue done, if he had beene the high Prieſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He did this by Lot: ſo did not the high Prieſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Then ſhould he haue gone into the moſt Holy, which is not mentioned, and therefore not meant.</p>
               <p n="4">4 This his perfuming, was interceſſory, as may appeare by the peoples praying in the meane while.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Zachary went home into the country, the high Prieſts houſe was in Hieruſalem, looke Adrichom, 15, 1.</p>
               <p n="6">6 For the propitiatory, God gaue order that none ſhould be in the Temple, now there weare a great many.</p>
               <p n="7">7 The high Prieſt at this time might be named, Matthias
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1866:178"/>the ſonne of Theophilus.</p>
               <p>This incenſe burning was the former.</p>
               <p>It was ceremoniall, as may appeare, Exod, 30.</p>
               <p>The ſubſtance hereof, and of others was Chriſt making interceſſion for vs. Now indeed to compare it with Chriſt, it was but baſe.</p>
               <p>Yet was it very ſweet. Looke Exod, 30.34, 35, 36, 37.</p>
               <p>It was burnt in the morning and euening. Looke Exod. 30, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>I gather then 1 That the Papiſts haue no colour for their Frankincenſe burning at their maſſe, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this place or ſuch others.</p>
               <p>All ceremonies were mortall in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, died in Chriſt, were deadly afterwards.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Chriſt is our Mediator, not onely of redemption, but interceſſion. Ephe. 5, 2.</p>

               <p n="4">4 As the perfume ſmelled ſweet, ſo dooth Chriſt in the noſtrils of God, and we in him.</p>
               <p n="5">5 As this perfume was daily, ſo ſhould we ſeeke to God in Chriſt euery day.</p>
               <p n="6">6 As this was euening, and morning, ſo ſhould be begin and end the day by prayers to God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The order is, (for it is heere beſt to take the wordes as they lie) <hi>when, or after he went into the Temple of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not that he had not his priuate prayers before.</p>
               <p>This order noteth the place, the place is marked by his comming to it, and the owner of it.</p>
               <p>The place is <hi>the Temple whereto he came,</hi> the owner of it is <hi>the Lord.</hi>

               <p>This manner of diſtinction was ceremonious, and for thoſe times, as the Author to the Hebrewes noteth, 9, 10.</p>

               <p>Obiect. Gods Temple was ſo: therefore.</p>
               <p>Solu. God directed it ſo.

               <p>This ſetteth out the time preciſely, and ſeemeth to haue beene in the feaſt of trumpets.</p>
               <p>Iohn was prophecied to be the voice of a crier.

               <p>I thinke this latter. Looke the title of the Pſalm, 22.</p>
               <p>Sure it was ſome ſet forme of prayer, to agree with the ſet forme of the incenſe-burning.</p>

               <p>VVomen are not heere mentioned, but ſure it is there were of them. As may appeare by Anna, 1, Sam, 1, and Luke, 2, 30.</p>

               <p>Yea children came, as may appeare by the precept. Exo. 23, 17. and the practiſe, Luke the 2, 42, 43. Thus ſeemeth Paule to haue beene brought vp. Nowe for that good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are patterns for vs, we muſt learne,</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Angell</hi> is a greeke word, and ſignifieth in ſcriptures, firſt a nature or ſubſtance ſpirituall, created according to the image of God, being no part of another. And this is one of the moſt excellenteſt creatures that are.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſignifieth office, or one ſent, in which ſenſe, Iohn the Baptiſt is called an Angell. Mala: 3, 1.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it ſignifieth both theſe together, as els where in
<pb facs="tcp:1866:183"/>ſcriptures, ſo in this place. And ſo Angells are ſayd to be miniſtring ſpirits, &amp;c. Heb, 1, 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord,</hi> heere, is the true Iehoua, whoſe, the Angells are ſayd to be.</p>

               <p>Yet is it not ordinary, eſpecially in theſe latter times, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly to vſe theſe toward men. We may learne from hence.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Angels are not onely motions, they are eſſences and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p n="2">2 How carefull God is for the good of his children, that rather then they ſhould want, ſendeth his owne Angels for their good.</p>
               <p>Queſt. Could not God haue acquainted Zacharias with this, ſome other way?</p>
               <p>Aun. Yes: but for the excellency of the thing he vſed an Angell.</p>
               <p n="3">3 We muſt take heede how we hurt godly men, vpon whom Angels doe attend.</p>
               <p n="4">4 We ought to be ready to ſerue the neceſſities of the Saintes, ſithens the Angels are ſo,</p>
               <p n="5">5 None ſhould thinke baſely of the Miniſterie, ſeeing Angels ſome times execute the duties thereof, and that in ſmaller matters, then to teach ſaluation by Chriſt. So that parents ſhould not grutch their children to the Miniſtery.</p>
               <p>The manner of preſence followeth, <hi>appeared to him.</hi> Heere is how he bewrayed himſelfe, and to whom.</p>
               <p>He bewrayed himſelfe to ſight, for ſo ſignified the word appeared, that is, was ſeene.</p>
               <p>Hee appeared by hauing a bodily ſhape (moſt likely of a man) wherein appeared extraordinary brightneſſe.</p>
               <p>Otherwiſe Angels haue no bodies of their owne.</p>
               <p>The bodies they haue, are not Phantaſticall, but made and diſſolued by God.</p>

               <p> Why do Angels appeare like men? Some thinke, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times to prefigure the incarnation of Chriſt: I iudge, that they might more familiarly be with men.</p>
               <p>This appearing is extraordinary.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Doe not thinke that Angels haue bodies of their own: Thevr wings ſignifie theyr ſwiftneſſe to doe the will of GOD.</p>

               <p>So godly men finde more fauours then they looke for. Some beeing hoſpitall, receiued Angels. Heb, 13, 2.</p>

               <p n="2">2 No doubt Zacharias was not thus but vpon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſo as wee muſt not iudge of our eſtate by preſent fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and confidence.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It is hard to come to a thorough inſight into our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or meaſure of ſtrength.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If godly men be ſometimes thus ſhaken, themſelues nor others, muſt not for that miſlike them.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And if godly men feele theſe ſomtimes, what may the wicked looke for?</p>
               <p>The occaſion is <hi>ſeeing,</hi> that is, the Angel.</p>
               <p>Not onely for that he was in a place, where at ſuch times none but the Prieſts were to be, but alſo for that there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſome glory and maieſtie, more then ordinary in a man.</p>
               <p>It is to be marked, that the Angel comming to Zacharias was ſeene of him. Balaam a good while could not ſee the Angel.</p>
               <p n="1">1 This muſt we labour after, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God offereth meanes to ſee and perceiue them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Till Zacharias ſaw, he did not feare, whereby our not fearing, or hauing hart in our ſelues, is for that wee ſee not God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It is maruaile that God himſelfe beeing preſent euery where, Zacharias could not open the eyes of his minde to perceiue him, but was more affected with bodily ſight: ſuch is all our weakneſſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If Zacharias was thus affected at ſight, why are we no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at hearing Gods word, and feeling his corrections?</p>
               <p>Queſt. Did not Zacharias feare before? An. Yes. But when more occaſion was offered, he feared more. So muſt wee.</p>
               <p>Zacharias ſaw the Angell appearing in a bodily ſhape.</p>
               <p>An Angell is but a creature, ſomewhat indeede aboue a man.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Learne a practiſe of humiliation, when you would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1866:184"/>your ſelfe, neuer compare your ſelfe with your equall or inferiour, but with ſuperiors, otherwiſe then the moſt doe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If Zacharias could not abide the preſence of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt, what would hee or wee doe at the preſence of the Lord?</p>
               <p n="3">3 And if a meſſenger of good tydings be thus terrible, what would one that ſhould denounce the euerlaſting wrath of God?</p>
               <p n="4">4 And ſeeing that Zacharias thus feared, it cannot be, but wicked men at Gods preſence, will call for the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to fall vpon them, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>There remaineth, that he <hi>was troubled, and feare fell vpon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heere are two branches, the firſt, that <hi>he was troubled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This word <hi>troubled,</hi> is like water ſtirred when one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee through it, &amp; ſheweth a great perplexitie of mind, when one cannot tell what to thinke. Some ſuch thing is ſaid of Chriſt. Iohn, 11, 33. Iohn, 13, 21.</p>
               <p>Saue that Chriſt troubled himſelfe, God troubled Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias: Chriſt was like faire water in a pure glaſſe without mixture of dregs, Zacharias was not ſo.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Learne that Chriſtians ſhould not be Stoicks, without affections, or paſſions.</p>
               <p n="2">2 They ſometimes in ſomethings are ignorant.</p>
               <p n="3">3 For a time, ſometimes they are at theyr wits end.</p>
               <p n="4">4 So to be exerciſed, is not a deſperate eſtate, no more then Zacharias was.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Zacharias beeing in it, ranne not away, but ſtoode it out: ſo muſt we, and ſhall haue a good iſſue.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, <hi>feare fell vpon,</hi> the affection, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie.</p>
               <p>Affection, <hi>feare,</hi> propertie, ſuddainneſſe.</p>
               <p>Feare heere ſignifieth looking to ſuffer ſome euill. This is the worſer kinde of feare. There is another, which is of deſiring to doe no euill.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The former feare is not euill, ſo it be not alone.</p>
               <p n="2">

               <p n="3">3 Now as Zacharias ſaid nothing, it ſhould be our beſt courſe if we came where euill apparitions are, not (as many doe) to offer ſpeech.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Angell,</hi> far aboue man in excellencie, ſent to man, thinketh no ſcorne to doe the meſſage himſelfe.</p>
               <p>No more ſhould any, how great ſoeuer their places be, refuſe to doe their duties, euen to the meaneſt, and if neede be, euen by themſelues.</p>
               <p>It may be demaunded, whether this ſaying or ſpeaking was with ſome ſound to the eare or ſence, to the minde or
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1866:185"/>both.</p>
               <p>Aun. The Angell appearing in a bodily ſhape, might vſe a bodily voice.</p>
               <p>Sure it is Zacharias did vnderſtand him.</p>
               <p>So muſt Angels ſpeake as that they may be vnderſtood.</p>
               <p>So muſt people heare as vnderſtand.</p>
               <p>Zacharias when the Angell ſpake vnto him, was greatly perplexed.</p>
               <p>Thus God neglecteth not the troubled, but many times in their greateſt neede cheereth them vp.</p>
               <p>Now followeth what he ſpake, <hi>feare not Zacharias,</hi> and ſo on to the end of the 17 verſe.</p>
               <p>All which ſpeech is partly, 1 comfort to Zacharias in his preſent eſtate. 2 words of the Angels generall charge.</p>
               <p>Of comfort, <hi>feare not Zacharias.</hi> Where firſt it may be demanded, whether the Angell were ſent of purpoſe to comfort Zacharias.</p>
               <p>Aun. I thinke, no: Neuertheleſſe Zacharias his feare falling out, God would haue him comforted, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels meſſage might be the better entertained. This the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell preſently knowing from God, comforteth Zacharias.</p>
               <p n="1">1 None of vs muſt without warrant from God, aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vpon any thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2 We ought like the Angels quickly to perceiue the wil &amp; meaning of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 God would haue vs ſo to be diſpoſed in minde, as that his commandements might ſinck the deeper into vs.</p>
               <p>So are we diſpoſed when caſt downe by feare, we are lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp by faith.</p>
               <p>This comfort, forbiddeth <hi>to feare,</hi> where we may marke the manner of ſpeaking to the party, and the words of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>The manner is, that the Angell calleth him by his name, Zacharias.</p>
               <p>Thereby ſhewing that this appariſion was not a thing at all aduentures, but for Zacharias ſake, which he likewiſe ſhould marke.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:186"/>
               <p> God would haue his people know, when he ſendeth generall meanes, he doth particularly reſpect his.</p>
               <p>The people of God muſt particularly apply theſe meanes to themſelues.</p>
               <p>The words of comfort, are, <hi>feare not,</hi> and ſignifie not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he ſhould not feare, but ſhould be of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>
               <p>It may be demanded whether all feare is heere forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
               <p>Aun. No. For ſome feare is neceſſary and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.</p>
               <p>Queſt. What feare is forbidden? An: we muſt conſider that feare is diuers, 1 Some proceedeth from vnbeleefe, ſome from faith: againe, ſome feare driueth from God, ſome to ſeeke God and his fauour.</p>
               <p>Some feare is to ſuffer euill, ſome, to doe euill.</p>
               <p>That feare is heere forbidden which is from vnbeliefe, which driueth from God.</p>
               <p>That feare which is to ſuffer euill, is not ſimply forbidden, except it be alone without feare of doing euill, or be immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat and too much.</p>
               <p>Otherwiſe it hath it vſe to preſerue humility, the ſoftneſſe of the hart, ſtirring vp to prayer.</p>
               <p>Now for that Zachary did feare too much, he is bid not to feare, that is, as he did, or ſo much.</p>
               <p>Where we may ſee, that Gods children thinke themſelues, many times in worſe eſtate then indeed they are.</p>
               <p>That they haue not ſuch cauſe to feare, as they thinke many times they haue.</p>
               <p>Queſt. How ſhould I know whether I ought to feare?</p>
               <p>Aun. Search your conſcience, if you find any ſin vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, feare.</p>
               <p>Zachary muſt not only not feare, but be of good cheere, that is, be perſwaded of Gods loue toward him, and looke for a benefit.</p>
               <p>So muſt euery repentant ſinner doe.</p>
               <p>Indeed will ſome ſay, if a good Angell did bid me not
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1866:186"/>feare; it were ſomwhat.</p>
               <p>Aun. We haue the promiſes of God in his word, aboue the Angels words.</p>
               <p>Thus far for the comfort, now follow the words of the Angels generall charge, <hi>for thy prayer is heard, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe we may conſider ioyned to the former, or whole in them ſelues.</p>
               <p>The word ioyning them is, <hi>for,</hi> which ſheweth that the Angell preſently maketh profitable vſe of his meſſage, as euery Angel in office ought to doe. Miniſters are Surgeons, and Phyſitians, to apply plaiſters to vlcers, and medicines to diſeaſes,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay, 50,</hi> 4</note> &amp; therefore doth God giue them the tongue of the learned to miniſter a word in ſeaſon, inſtruction to ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, comfort to the heauy ſoule, reproofe to the ſinner: ſo as people ſhould pray that their Miniſters thus ſhould doe, and themſelues ſhould deſire thus (if they will be healed) to be delt with.</p>
               <p>In this manner the Angell applieth: he whoſe prayer is heard, and who ſhall haue a moſt excellent ſonne, muſt not feare.</p>
               <p>But thy prayer is heard, and thou ſhalt haue a ſonne. Therefore.</p>
               <p>Now that one whoſe prayers are heard, neede not feare, it is cleere, for God who heareth, doth promiſe to heare in loue; and the things prayed for, and granted, are ſuch as ſhew we are in moſt high fauour with God, as forgiueneſſe of ſin, iuſtification, adoption, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The like might be ſaid of ſuch a child as Iohn was.</p>
               <p>The words of the meſſage or charge whole in themſelues followe, an haue two branches: 1 <hi>thy prayer is heard:</hi> 2 <hi>thy wife Elizabet ſhall beare thee a child.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the former we may conſider, 1 Zacharies practiſe of <hi>prayer,</hi> 2 The ſucceſſe: <hi>is heard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The word heere tranſlated <hi>prayer,</hi> is in Greeke as much as deprecatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is, prayer for remouing, or keeping away euils, but by a ſpeech, putting part for the whole, is well tranſlated, <hi>prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:187"/>
               <p> Prayer is a crauing for of things from God, according to his will.</p>
               <p>Gods will requireth that our prayers ſhould haue war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Of commandement to pray and promiſe to be heard.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That we ſhould deſire to be heard for Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That we ſhould haue a feeling of the things we pray for.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That we ſhould aske in ſpeciall faith, with perſwaſion that we ſhalbe heard.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That we muſt pray in repentance, and charity.</p>
               <p n="6">6 That we refer the performance of our prayers to the glory of God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. What did Zachary pray for?</p>
               <p>Aun. All things neceſſary for his owne ſaluation, the diſcharge of his place at home and abroade in his prieſts office, and for outward comforts, as a child: ſo far as God ſhould ſee good.</p>
               <p>And this prayer of his, was not once, but iterated and often.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Learne that it is one dutie of Gods children, to pray.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And that according to the former rules.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And for things which they ought to wiſh for.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And that with frequentation, and continuance.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the ſucceſſe, <hi>is heard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. Of whom? Aun. Of him to whom it was made namely of God.</p>
               <p>Hearing is properly in a body which hath eares, and is aſcribed to God according to the worke of hearing, which is to conuey knowledge, ſo as <hi>that, is heard:</hi> is as much as if he ſhould ſay, is taken knowledge of.</p>
               <p>Gods taking knowledge is of all things and perſons in generall; and of his Church and children in ſpeciall.</p>
               <p>This ſecond kind is heere meant.</p>
               <p>It hath 2 degrees 1: approbation, the ſecond perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the prayer.</p>
               <p>Approbation is whereby God liketh the petition.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:1866:187"/>
               <p> Performance is, when God doth the thing deſired.</p>
               <p>God alwaies liketh the prayers, ſometimes hee doth not performe them, and that for theſe endes.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That hee might exerciſe theyr faith and hope with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graces, which would not be ſo much, if we had feeling and enioying.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To make vs thinke better of the things the longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That God might ſhew his ſeruants to pray as well for conſcience, as reward, not all for what will ye giue me.</p>
               <p n="4">4 To inure his children more to humiliation, and to beare croſſings of men, when God himſelfe thus dealeth with his children.</p>
               <p n="5">5 To make vs more thankfull for good things when we haue them.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Know that God alloweth not euery bodies prayer.</p>

               <p n="4">4 When GOD ſeeth good, he performeth the deſires of his children.</p>
               <p>Que. Why doth the Angell tell Zachary that his prayer was heard?</p>
               <p>Aun. Becauſe not onely he, but the beſt of Gods chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſometimes doubt heereof at ſome inſtant, ſo as that if we be aſſailed with ſuch feare, it was Zacharias his caſe.</p>
               <p>Queſt. How might I know that my prayer is heard, no Angell telling me ſo?</p>
               <p>Aun. Gods word telleth vs, that if we aske things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, God heareth vs, and this is as good as if all the Angels in heauen ſhould tell vs.</p>

               <p n="2">2 And they who are child-bearing, let them ſeeke to God, he can ſend if they want children.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Though wiues be old, GOD can affoord ſufficient comfort by them, though not children, others as good as that, yea many times more ſounder then younger.</p>
               <p>Wiues who are not wayed, know not theyr duties, theyr husbands diſpoſitions, are not euery way fitted equally to draw.</p>
               <p>So as that men ſhould not miſlike the wife of their youth in her age.</p>
               <p>He calleth her by the name of his wife, as he would haue done toward any other man, not a Prieſt, he ſpeaketh not diſdainfully, or ſcornfully.</p>
               <p>So ſhould we learne to ſpeake of Biſhops, wiues, vvho may as well marry as any, and that by the learning of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, not vowing.</p>
               <p>Her name is <hi>Eliſabet,</hi> that ſignifieth the oath of the mightie God.</p>
               <p>I know not how true that obſeruation of ſome Iewes is, that good people are ſet downe by name in ſcriptures: not ſo wicked.</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:1866:188"/>
               <p> I take it ſhe is named as to ſhew, that euen by that his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and old wife, ſhould haue a ſonne.</p>
               <p>He had but this one wife, ſo is the miracle manifeſt.</p>
               <p>The manner ſtandeth next, <hi>ſhall beare,</hi> where is the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner, and the time indefinit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beare,</hi> the word vſed, ſignifieth as wel to beget as beare, the meaning is, ſhall conceiue, goe with child, and in time be ſafe deliuered.</p>
               <p>It had beene ſome comfort, that ſhe might haue helped to bring it vp as a dry Nurſe, but to beare it in her body was very much: not only in reſpect of the great paines of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing in any, but eſpecially of the firſt childe, when the Mother is very old, or very young, there is great danger, &amp; yet the ſpirit of God ſpeaketh nothing hereof, though it implyeth them.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Mark that theſe outward burdens of bearing &amp; bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp children, are common to the godly and wicked, ſo as that the moſt godly ſhall not be freed from them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Women thinking of paines of child-bearing, ſhould renue repentance for the firſt fall, remembring the curſe euer ſince.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Though Gods benefits be ſometimes mingled vvith croſſes and hardneſſe, wee muſt not be diſcouraged, looke not at the hardneſſe, looke vpon the fauour.</p>
               <p>The time is indefinitely ſet, 1 to exerciſe his faith.</p>
               <p>And yet God performed it as ſoone as might be, ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers times God dealeth with his.</p>
               <p>The party to whom this gift is, <hi>to thee:</hi> O old, and not very rich Zacharias.</p>
               <p>Que. To me might Zacharias ſay, and not to herſelfe?</p>
               <p>Aun. Yes to her to, but to thee as of thy body lawfullie begotten, which thou in moſt ſpeciall ſort muſt thinke of for thy ſelfe, becauſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1 How ſoeuer children are to the Mother, they keepe, and propagate the Fathers name to poſteritie, and ſtand in his ſtead.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In old age begotten, they are wont to be loued moſt,
<pb facs="tcp:1866:189"/>as Gene, 24, 36, and Gene, 37, 3.</p>
               <p>For that the Father ſeeing them, thinketh him ſelfe not altogether ſpent, is delighted to refreſh himſelfe vvith ſuch young things, but eſpecially, if he haue but one, and that prooue toward, and likely to doe well, ſo is it heere.</p>
               <p>And it is to be marked, that the Angell ſaith, ſhee ſhall beare to thee, and neuer forbeareth to tell him this, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his age, or want of wealth.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Thinke that if wee haue ſuch ioy to haue a childe in our old age, what pleaſure doth GOD take in our beeing borne anew to him, after long time.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Euen Fathers ought to loue their children, and the more, becauſe they haue had the leſſe paines with them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 We muſt not be diſcouraged if God ſend vs children, when we are not likely to liue to ſee their bringing vp, or if we haue not great wealth in that kind, let vs doe our vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt for the preſent, and leaue the reſt to God. Salomon and loſeph did not fare worſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Children are bound to increaſe mutuall loue between parents.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Husbands ſhould more loue theyr wiues, for more children brought forth. Looke Gene 29, 34, 1, Sam, 1.</p>
               <p>The kind of benefit is <hi>a ſonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A child is a benefit.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially to a Iew.</p>
               <p>Promiſed children in ſcriptures were excellent, as Iſaac, Ioſiah, Chriſt, Sampſon, the Shunamites child, whom ſome thinke to haue beene Ionas the prophet.</p>
               <p>Let vs thanke God for children, and indeauour they may be good, by praying for them, giuing them to God, vſing all meanes for their good.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the further, or more largely ſetting downe of the latter clauſe of his meſſage, and that 1 by the name 2 by the effects of this child.</p>
               <p>For the name, it is ſaid, <hi>thou ſhalt call his name Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherein we may conſider the name, the party who giueth order for it, the meanes by whom it is.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:1866:189"/>
               <p> The name is <hi>Iohn.</hi> Iohn may ſome body ſay: did the Angell ſpeake Engliſh?</p>
               <p>No, but he ſignified ſuch a name as our Iohn expreſſeth.</p>
               <p>The name Iohn, in the Hebrew or Siriack is of the name God, <hi>Iah:</hi> and a word which ſignifieth fauour, fauoured of God.</p>
               <p>Neither is this name thus, but all for the moſt of ſcripture names are ſignificatiue, implying ſome good thing.</p>
               <p>So ſhould our names which we giue be.</p>
               <p>Some offend in exceſſe, as thoſe who take names of God, as Ieſuits, <hi>Emmanuel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of Angels, as Gabriel, Michael, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Of vertues, as patience, grace, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In defect, as giuing names of flowers or ſtones, or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then names to Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Queſt. Is it not lawfull to giue any of theſe latter names noted.</p>
               <p>Aun. I thinke it not ſo conuenient, for that there be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very good, and we ought to vſe what meanes of good we can, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The party who giueth this name is implied, to be he who ſent the Angell, what is God, ſo hath he giuen names to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choiſe perſons in ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>To teach vs to marke ſuch notable perſonages, whom God hath ſo called, we ſhall find many worthy things in them.</p>
               <p>As alſo that we ſhould marke euen names, and the leaſt things in ſcripture, much more the greateſt.</p>
               <p>Now it is to be marked that it is ſaid, thou ſhalt call, that is, thou oughteſt to call when I ſo appoint, that though it be but a ſmall matter, thou doe not violate this charge.</p>
               <p>Nothing is little which God commandeth.</p>
               <p>One cannot be to preciſe in keeping the leaſt of Gods appointments.</p>
               <p>The meanes by whom this name is giuen, <hi>thou:</hi> that is, his father.</p>
               <p>So doe we ſee elſwhere in ſcriptures, ſo did Adam giue
<pb facs="tcp:1866:190"/>names to the creatures, ſo did Iacob change <hi>Be-nonie</hi> to <hi>Beniamin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas mothers doe it, it ſhould be by the liking of fathers.</p>
               <p>Wherefore Parents ſhould not wholy put ouer this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of name giuing to children, to the witneſſes.</p>
               <p>And if the father ſhould giue the name, it is moſt meete he ſhould be preſent at the giuing of it, for that in his right, the child is intereſſed in the couenant.</p>

               <p>One party is the father, the other many,</p>
               <p>The father was old, and as it might ſeeme, comfortleſſe in this age, yet God reſpecteth him, as no doubt he doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the like caſe.</p>
               <p>Ob. It may be demanded; whether the mother ſhould not haue comfort.</p>
               <p>Sol. Yes: but that is implied in the fathers ioy.</p>
               <p>The things which are ſaid to befall the father, are ioy and gladneſſe, both which ariſe from conceit of ſome preſent or hoped good.</p>
               <p>They differ not much, ſaue that ioy may be ſaid to be more inward, gladneſſe more outward: ioy the leſle, glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the more.</p>

               <p>Theſe were to be in Zachary in the beſt kind.</p>
               <p>It is not ſaid whence theſe ſhould come, certaine it is from GOD. Godly men are not Stoicks. All reioycing is not lawfull. The ioy we haue, God giueth. God giueth for comfort.</p>

               <p>The effects in reſpect of other (who are many) followe. Where beſides the parties, we may conſider the kind of thing, and the occaſion. We will begin backward. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is <hi>his:</hi> that is, <hi>Iohn Baptists birth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His birth, to ſpeake properly, is his comming into the world, but this is not meant alone, but eſpecially his life, office, and diſcharge thereof in loue, whereof they are ſaid to reioyce at his birth; ſo Iob miſliking his life, curſeth his birth, conception, &amp;c, 3 Iob. 3, thus in deteſtation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball and Ahab is ſaid, that <hi>there ſhall not be left a dog, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Now thus affections thus noted of the people, ſhould teach vs offices, and that,</p>
               <p n="1">1 The nature of true loue ſtretcheth to all things, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the thing beloued.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That men muſt be iudged of by their duties, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Men muſt loue miniſteries, like Iohns conuincing of ſinne.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Yet ſo, as that they muſt loue Chriſt whereto they muſt be lead.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And ſeeing that Iohn was as well for the whole Church as priuate perſons, we all ſhould reioyce at occaſions of Church good.</p>
               <p>The affection noted in the parties is, <hi>that they ſhall reioyce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reioycing (I take it) is nothing but to bewray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ioy.</p>
               <p>This was, as eſpecially by the former occaſion, ſo not without ſimpathy to Zacharias and Eliſabets ioy.</p>
               <p>The reioycing is alwaies with ſome feeling. And as a man would thinke, but a ſmall matter where no dooing is mentioned: yet it is implied that they witneſſed their ioy.</p>

               <p n="2">2 If we can doe nothing els, it is acceptable to God, when

               <p>So as who doe not, are iuſtly to be blamed.</p>
               <p>The cauſes in themſelues are reckoned vp in 4 branches.</p>
               <p>The firſt,
<label type="milestone">

                  <hi>he,</hi> that is, Iohn, <hi>ſhalbe great in the ſight of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where we may ſee what is ſaid of him: <hi>he ſhalbe great.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in what ſenſe, <hi>in the ſight of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Great.</hi> Iohn is ſo as that none greater then he among womens children.</p>
               <p>And this great, is of great account and worth, the ſame in meaning with good.</p>
               <p>Great was Iohn, as appointed to doe great things, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare men to Chriſt, indued with great graces of knowledge, zeale, courage, &amp;c. effecting great things, ſo as that many ſubmitted themſelues to his miniſtery. Luke, 3.</p>
               <p>Now Iohn is not ſaid ſimply to be great, as in the eyes of the world, for he was very contemptible, but in <hi>the ſight of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:1866:191"/>
               <p> The Lord heere ſignifieth the true God.</p>
               <p>Sight is a borrowed ſpeech, taken from ſuch creatures as haue eyes, whereby the vſe of eyes, and that which followeth thereon is implied: and therefore when this ſpeech is vſed towards creatures in generall, or wicked, it implieth Gods knowledge; as Emrod was a mighty hunter before the Lord, that is, openly, and knowen of God. But when it is vſed toward godly perſons, then it ſignifieth to approue as heere, and before of Zachary and Eliſabet it was ſaid, they were <hi>iust before God,</hi> that is, God approuing their iuſtice.</p>
               <p>Know then that Gods children are great ſome way.</p>
               <p>Though indeede, not alwaies to the world ward,</p>
               <p>So as that wee ought not to iudge of ones greatneſſe by his outward appearance to the world.</p>
               <p>That who ſo would be great, muſt be in the ſight of God by Chriſt, and the gifts of his Spirit.</p>
               <p>If godly men be great with GOD, they ought ſo to be with vs.</p>
               <p>And in no caſe muſt we wrong them, leaſt wee prouoke God againſt vs.</p>
               <p>The ſecond branch is, <hi>and ſhall neither drinke wine, nor strong drinke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words declare that he ſhould be a Nazarite, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of looke Numb, 6, 3, ſo was Sampſon, ſaue that the Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, Numb, 6, 2, vowed themſelues, Sampſon and Iohn were appointed by God.</p>
               <p>One part of the Nazarites dutie was, <hi>neither to drinke wine, nor strong drinke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wine is the blood, or iuyce of grapes.</p>
               <p>Strong drinke, in the originall <hi>Shekar,</hi> any made drinke, which immoderatly vſed, will procure drunkennes, as the Iewes had luyce of Dates. In Wales is Metheglin, in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Husqueba, in England Sider, Beere, Ale.</p>
               <p>Now this, and ſuch like was forbidden them.</p>
               <p>Queſt. Why were theſe forbidden?</p>
               <p>Aun. Not for any vnholineſſe in them, or that men by forbearing of them onely were more holy, but to teach
<pb facs="tcp:1866:192"/>moderation by ſome in all things, and to ſhew that a means to helpe heereto, is to forbeare lawfull things.</p>
               <p>It may ſeeme ſtrange, that Iohn ſhould forbeare Wine, and Chriſt drinke it.</p>
               <p>Whereby wee may learne, not to iudge of mens holines onely by their outward ſtrictneſſe, els might wee preferre Iohn before Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Obiect. It may be obiected, that Chriſt was a Nazarite, Math, 2, 23, and therefore ſhould not drinke Wine.</p>
               <p>Solu. It was not meant that he ſhould be ſuch a profeſſed Nazarite, as the Law nameth, but he ſhould be ſuch a moſt holy perſon, as the Nazarite prefigured. So Chriſt is a Lambe, who was prefigured by Lambes.</p>
               <p>If Iohn would forbeare Wine, wee ought to forbeare ſinne.</p>
               <p>And if hee quite forbore ſtrong drinke, wee muſt take heede of drunkenneſſe.</p>
               <p>The third branch is, <hi>that hee ſhall be filled with the holie Ghoſt, euen from his Mothers wombe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherein is a ſpeciall gift to be beſtowed vppon him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. This gift is the holy Ghoſt, which is further made knowne by the meaſure of it, in that it is ſaid, <hi>he ſhall be full,</hi> and the time, in as much as it ſhall be <hi>fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his mothers wombe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The gift is moſt excellent, ſo as GOD when hee would finde out the choiſeſt, could not beſtow a better on Iohn, no not on his owne ſonne.</p>
               <p>Whereby we may learne wherof to make moſt account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> is the third perſon in Trinitie, and is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put for the perſon it ſelfe, ſometimes for his workes, as heere it is.</p>
               <p>Among the many works of the holie Ghoſt, is
<list>
                     <item>ſanctification.</item>
                     <item>furniſhing to particular calling.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Sanctification is wherby a partie is made holy in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, Chriſt his holineſſe imputed, and new in the partie ingenerated.</p>
               <p>This in parties of yeeres, is neuer without faith.</p>
               <p>Queſt. Is it heere meant, that Iohn from his Mothers
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1866:192"/>wombe ſhould haue faith?</p>
               <p>Aun. We may ſpeake of faith in the ſeede, and as it may proue afterward or as it is preſent: if in the ſeede (as the full care may be ſaid to be in the graine) it may be allowed, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it is not actuall, for children haue no knowledge.</p>
               <p>Ob. It is ſaid without faith we cannot pleaſe God: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Aun. That is meant in parties of diſcretion and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Many ſuch ſpeeches haue their limitation. The partie that was not circumciſed was threatned to be cut of from out of Gods people: and yet many died before time of circumciſion: therefore it is meant of contemning. So whoſoeuer eateth not Chriſts fleſh, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Furniſhing to particular calling is, whereby one is endued with abilitie, to doe the worke of his warrantable calling.</p>
               <p>Now this gift is promiſed, not only as excellent, but as neceſſary.</p>
               <p>And though Iohn Baptiſt were an extraordinarie man, yet ſomewhat in this is for our inſtruction.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It is neceſſary for euery one in his place to haue the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Holy Ghoſt muſt ſhew himſelfe in euery of vs, by ſainctification and abilities for our calling.</p>
               <p n="3">3 If gifts for particular calling are of the holy Ghoſt, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular callings in their kind are holy.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That which was giuen to Iohn extraordinarily, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon vs by meanes of the word, prayer, endeauour.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Gifts of the Spirit muſt be vſed to the honour of the giuer.</p>
               <p>The meaſure followeth, <hi>filled.</hi> This may ſome ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to Chriſt who hath fulneſſe.</p>
               <p>Aun. Chriſt hath fulneſſe of himſelfe, Iohn from Chriſt. Chriſt hath perfect fulneſſe, Iohn but in compariſon of others, ſo as this <hi>filled,</hi> is to haue a great meaſure aboue other men. The ſame is contrary, Act, 5, 3.</p>
               <p n="1">1 See, that God giueth not all alike to all. So as none muſt repine at others, or be grieued for themſelues.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb facs="tcp:1866:193"/> 2 In the greater places men are, the more fulneſſe neede they of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Great places are to be iudged by the great good they procure, and the great numbers they haue to doe with.</p>
               <p>Therefore Princes, Magiſtrates, Miniſters, maiſters of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, muſt labour for more then others.</p>
               <p>The time is, <hi>from his mothers wombe,</hi> the Syrian hath it, <hi>in his mothers wombe:</hi> the meaning is, as ſoone as poſſibly may be. So was it with Ieremie, Timothie, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">1 So God furniſheth before he vſe men. Men therefore muſt looke to their giftes, before they venture on places.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He furniſheth as ſoone as may be, to teach vs that we ought ſo to doe in our children, or with any we haue to deale with.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt branch remaineth, verſe, 16, 17. Which ſheweth a great worke that Iohn ſhall doe.
<label type="milestone">

               <p>It is named in that it is ſaid, <hi>and many of the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell ſhall he turne to their Lord God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Marke what is a cheefeſt worke, that God ſetteth his about.</p>
               <p>It may be marueiled this to turne men being a worke of God, how it can be ſaid of Iohn.</p>
               <p>Not indeede for that Iohn did it by his owne power or godlineſſe, but for that he was the meanes which God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The like is elſwhere.</p>
               <p n="1">1 This ſhould teach vs to vſe all meanes with reuerence.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In the due vſe of meanes, to waite for bleſſing.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That we neede not ſeeke outward and worldly helpes, ſince Iohn ſo ſilly a man for the world, wrought this.</p>
               <p>The worke we may conſider in it ſelfe, and toward the perſons whom it is ſaid to concerne.</p>
               <p>In it ſelfe, it is <hi>conuerting to their Lord God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conuerting, is the ſame that is to cauſe to repent: yet by it is implied a turning a ſide, ſo indeede haue we all done.</p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:1866:193"/>
               <p> And in this worke, we may marke the nature of it, and that whereto it muſt be. The nature is, <hi>conuerting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conuerting is changing. For better vnderſtanding whereof, we may conſider the thing to be conuerted, the properties of conuerſion, and the parts.</p>
               <p>The thing is the whole man.</p>
               <p>The properties are: that, 1 it muſt be true: 2 preſent: 3 manifeſt: 4 continually: 5 daily mending.</p>
               <p>The parts are, 1 dying to ſin, in the practiſe, and in the power, 2 liuing to godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>That whereunto this turning is, is <hi>their Lord God,</hi> that is, <hi>the Lord their God,</hi> ſo that it is the <hi>Lord,</hi> who is further made knowen by this addition, <hi>their God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſpeaking heereof conſider the meaning, and of whom it is meant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord,</hi> doth ſignifie the true God as before, and that moſt properly in his eſſence: but not ſo heere, for Gods eſſence is euery where, and none can trune from it. But heere it is put for Gods fauour, and will: ſo Zephan, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>So that heere <hi>to the Lord,</hi> is to his will or liking. His will is our ſanctification, 1 Theſſ: 4, 3.</p>
               <p>And indeed the Angell meaneth to the liking or likneſſe of God and his image. The beginning whereof is in faith, and perfection in wiſedome and rightouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>So as that whoſoeuer will truely turne, 1 Muſt beleeue in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Muſt be holy, 3 Muſt be righteous.</p>
               <p>The addition whereby <hi>the Lord</hi> is made knowen, is <hi>their God,</hi> which are the words of the couenant. The foundation whereof is God, the parties couenanting, are God and the people.</p>
               <p>God bringeth all good things with him.</p>
               <p>He in couenanting offereth all good things. The people couenanting promiſe to doe as a people ſhould.</p>
               <p>Marke, 1 That though God offer a people neuer ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fauours, yet there may be want of turning actually to God.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb facs="tcp:1866:194"/> 2 That people profeſſing themſelues of God, may come ſhort in doing duties.</p>
               <p>But of whom may this be meant? It is true of the whole Trinity: neuertheleſſe heere it ſeemeth to be ſpoken of Chriſt. For it is to be taken of him, before whoſe face Iohn went; as Luc: 1, 17.</p>
               <p>Now ſure it is, Iohn was Chriſts fore-runner, and indeed Iohn did point to the Lambe of God. Iohn 1, 29.</p>
               <p>So as this place.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Proueth that Chriſt is the true Lord God, as likwiſe Thomas calleth him. Ioh, 20, 28.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That if we turne to God, it muſt be to Chriſt, and by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That to the Iewes was Chriſt offered.</p>
               <p>The perſons on whom this worke is, are <hi>many of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſraell,</hi> that is. Iſraelites; the children of Achaians for the Achaians, ſonne of man. Sonnes are poſteritie.</p>
               <p>Iſraell, before Iacob.</p>
               <p>Marke that backſliding children may come of good pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
               <p>So as parents muſt not ceaſe to bring vp theyr children in the feare of God: and if things fall out otherwiſe in their children then they deſire, to comfort themſelues in theyr duties doone.</p>
               <p>That though men haue meanes, as theſe Iſraelites, yet they may be turned from God.</p>
               <p>Such as are Iſraelites, when meanes ſerue, turne to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many,</hi> not all. For all are not turned. Many turne at one mans preaching, and that but a while, why doe we reuolt, and not be confirmed, and grow, at ſo many and ſo long time preaching?</p>

               <p>The perſon is ſaid to goe before him.</p>
               <p>This may ſerue to make knowne all ſeruitours, of what ſort ſoeuer generally, but more ſpecially Iohn the Baptiſt.</p>
               <p>All, that they muſt remember, they are before God, and ſo had neede to deale from the hart, which if they do God ſeeing, they may haue comfort whatſoeuer others thinke.</p>
               <p>Specially Iohn, where we may conſider, what hee is ſaid to doe, and in reſpect of whom.</p>
               <p>Hee is ſaide to <hi>goe before,</hi> that is, liue ſome-while before him, in the publique office of the miniſterie. For indeede ſo he did 6 months.</p>
               <p>This was but as a ſeruaunt, to make way, for the maiſter following to the embacing of himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Marke that precedence in time, is no note of true ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Though it be to our owne diſgrace, in compariſon of others, we muſt doe our duties.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of whom, this is Chriſt. One would haue thought that Chriſt ſhould haue gone before Iohn, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure credit to Iohn, not to ſende Iohn the weaker before him: but God in all his appointments muſt be obeied.</p>
               <p>The gift is the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> which differ I take it, as
<pb facs="tcp:1866:195"/>generall, and ſpeciall, or cauſe and effect: ſpirit is generall, power ſpeciall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spirit,</hi> doth ſignifie the gifts of the Spirit, whereby Iohn did his dutie.</p>
               <p>Iohns dutie was to preach repentance, and miniſter the ſacrament of Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>The gifts neceſſary heerunto, were 1 knowlege, 2 vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance: 3 zeale, which hath a great loue of God, and the people, which made him neglect no opportunities: 4 ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere and ſtrict life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Power,</hi> might ſignifie the efficacie which appeared in Iohns preaching, but that followeth afterward.</p>
               <p>I take it therefore for a gift, whereby hee could hold out in this his courſe againſt the ſcoffes of the Iewes, and frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of all Herods courtiers.</p>
               <p>Theſe things in Iohn were perſonall, and for that tyme, yet is there neede of the like gifts for like perſons in like times.</p>
               <p>Conſider whether our times may not in ſome ſort be like thoſe.</p>
               <p>The likneſſe of perſons, followeth in the perſon of Elias, though there be no note of likneſſe ſet out; ſo Eſa: 1, 10. Hoſ: 3, 5.</p>
               <p>It is not meant that Elias ſhould perſonally reuiue, or that by <hi>Metempſychoſis,</hi> his ſoule was in Iohn, as Pythagoras and ſome Iewes thought it might.</p>
               <p>But it is called the ſpirit of Elias, for being like his, as Numb: 11, 25, not that Moſes loſt any of the ſpirit, but for that they had the like. So the ſpirit of Elias is ſaid to reſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Elizeus, that is, gifts like vnto them. Otherwiſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences goe not from ſubiect to ſubiect.</p>
               <p>Fitly may Elias and Iohn be likened together in perſon, in reſpect of the corrupt times wherein they liued.</p>
               <p>Hauing not many aſſociats in the pure worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>Elias hauing to doe with Ahab and Ieſabell, Iohn with Herod and Herodias.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:1866:195"/>
               <p> They were both of great zeale, of auſtere life.</p>
               <p>The Iewes were deceiued, looking for perſonall Elias, ſo are the Papiſts, in the end of the world.</p>
               <p>Hetherto the likneſſe in gifts, the laſt is in worke, <hi>to turne the harts, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where are three ſpeeches, two of or from Malachie, the third of the Angell.</p>
               <p>The firſt, <hi>that he may turne,</hi> or, <hi>to turne the harts, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where is the thing he ſhall doe, and the parties in whom he ſhall doe it. The thing is, <hi>he ſhall turne harts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Turne:</hi> is as before, ſhall cauſe to repent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Harts,</hi> noteth the originall of true turning, namely, the hart.</p>
               <p>Hart metonimically is the ſoule, and ſo ſynecdochically the whole man.</p>
               <p>So as vnleſſe turning be from the hart, and the hart bring the whole man, there is no ſound repentance.</p>
               <p>The parties are <hi>the fathers toward the children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fathers and children all vnderſtand not alike. Some by Fathers meane the Iewes preſent, Scribes and Phariſees, el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in yeeres, and aboue in place, by children, Iohn, &amp; the Apoſtles, to whom Iohn by his preaching ſhould draw them to ioyne in faith and loue.</p>
               <p>Others by Fathers vnderſtand the Patriarches, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, Iacob, &amp;c, by children the preſent Iewes, as Iohn 8, 39, Math, 3, 9.</p>
               <p>Ob. Why, but then it were fitter to be ſaid, the harts of the children to the Fathers (for the Fathers nowe cannot change their minde) rather then of the Fathers to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>Aun. You ſhall read the like phraſes elſwhere in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Beſides, by a certaine metaphor, liking or miſliking is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to them in heauen. Though Abraham know vs not, that is, hath no cauſe to like vs.</p>
               <p>So Luke the 15, the Angels are ſaid to reioyce: ſo hell, Eſay, 14, 9.</p>

               <p> The latter is moſt probable. Now theſe are put for that part of the triumphant Church, whereto here Iohn below ſhould gather his hearers, in vnitie of the Spirit, and faith, and obedience.</p>
               <p>For the Church is Chriſtes body, gathered together in one, whereof that part in heauen is one, this in the earth the other.</p>

               <p n="1">1 Gods care towards vile ſinners, in tendering meanes.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And that grace commeth not alwayes with meanes.</p>
               <p>If for rebellious; firſt know what rebellion is. It is (I take it) to maintaine force againſt ones Soueraigne.</p>
               <p>This is metaphorically put for ſetled diſobedience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, how greeuous a ſinne rebellion is, looke, 1, Sam: 15, 23, that is, wondrouſly diſpleaſing vnto God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, how far one predeſtinate may run in ſinne, as to ſinne very greeuouſly, like Manaſſes, Paule, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that to greeuous ſinners repentant, God is good.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that theſe noted of rebellion, made a goodly ſhew for outward things in ſeruice of God: ſo may others.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>diſobedient</hi> are noted to be turned, <hi>to the wiſedome of the iuſt men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iuſt men,</hi> are as before, the Fathers. Who are called <hi>iuſt,</hi> for that Chriſts iuſtice is counted to them, and Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite worketh iuſtice in them, howſoeuer they haue many infirmities beſide.</p>
               <p>So muſt we be, with this muſt we comfort our ſelues.</p>
               <p>All read not this alike. The Greeke will beare as well <hi>by the wiſedome,</hi> as <hi>to the wiſedome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wiſedome,</hi> heere is that, which is properly called pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. This properly is a gift of God, whereby a man can well order all his actions.</p>
               <p>There is an other name which is <hi>Sopia,</hi> &amp; is wiſedome: which is a right and ſound information of the mind in all profitable truth.</p>
               <p>This wiſedome heere meant, ſignifieth metonymically, the wiſe courſe or life led. Where marke: that,</p>
               <p n="1">1 The godly are truly wiſe, and their directions right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations to wiſedome, otherwiſe then the world think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Memorandum, when they doe according to the Word.</p>
               <p n="2">2 They muſt walke wiſely, leſt they ſhame their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:197"/>
               <p> If we read it <hi>by the wiſedome,</hi> then is it appoſed to forcible meanes. For indeed true religion is neuer wrought in one, by compulſion. It is the gentle perſwaſion of the Spirit that winneth men.</p>
               <p>So as vnleſſe we bend our harts to attend and marke, we ſhall hardly be wone.</p>
               <p>If we read it <hi>to the wiſedome,</hi> we muſt know that wicked men muſt be turned to godly, not godly to wicked.</p>
               <p>The third, and laſt ſpeech followeth and is of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels owne adding from God, to <hi>prepare,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This in effect is the ſame with the former. Where is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, what Iohn ſhall doe, and vpon whom. <hi>He ſhall make ready for the Lord a people prepared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord,</hi> as it ſignifieth the true Iehouah, ſo alſo Chriſt, as verſe: 17.</p>
               <p>To make ready, is as the thing is: heere it ſignifieth to make ready to receiue Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Queſt. Did not thoſe who repented at Iohns preaching, and were baptiſed, receiue Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Aun. Yes: but not ſo cleerly, and ſo fully, as by Chriſt, and afterward.</p>
               <p>Know that,</p>
               <p n="1">1 All our preaching is to bring to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It is a good degree of profiting, to be fitter for Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3 We muſt alwayes be more and more fit to receiue Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A people,</hi> is many, as before. People, is moſt vſuall terme, to ſet out the Iewes by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prepared,</hi> is (as I take it) appointed. For to ſay, to make ready a thing prepared, repeateth the ſame.</p>
               <p>I iudge therefore, that the Angell meaneth, appointed from all eternitie, &amp; predeſtinated heerunto. So as whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is called and turned, is predeſtinated: neither are any conuerted who are not predeſtinated, and thoſe who are predeſtinate, muſt be prepared to conuerſion or turning.</p>
               <p>Thus far the Angels firſt ſpeech, his ſecond or anſwering
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1866:197"/>ſpeech followeth, from the 18 verſe to the end of the 20. And it is an anſwere of a demand, which Zachary made, verſe, 18.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore we muſt conſider the demaund, which is the occaſion: ſecondly, the anſwere, 19 and 20 verſe.</p>
               <p>The demaund is, <hi>then Zacharias ſaid to the Angell,</hi> &amp;c. Where is declared that he ſaid, and what it was.</p>
               <p>That he ſaid, <hi>then Zacharias ſaid to the Angell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And heere are to be conſidered, 1 the time, 2 perſons, 3 thing.</p>
               <p>The time <hi>then,</hi> in Greeke, <hi>and:</hi> it commeth to the ſame. The meaning is, that when the Angell had done ſpeaking, not before, Zacharias ſpoke. To teach vs,</p>
               <p n="1">1 That we muſt attend to all Gods word, and not leaue to heare.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It is a point of good manners, not to interrupt one in his ſpeech.</p>
               <p>The perſon ſpeaking is <hi>Zacharias,</hi> a iuſt man, and yet heere offending. So as iuſt men haue their weakneſſes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, 1 Godly men had neede be carefull ouer themſelues.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And wicked men haue no iuſt cauſe, to inſult vpon the godly for their ſlips.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And againe, godly men muſt not thinke their owne eſtate deſperate if they ſlip.</p>
               <p>The perſon to whom the ſpeech is, is the <hi>Angell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this Angell before. It is not ſaid that Zacharias knew it was an Angell, theſe are the Euangeliſts words. Neither was it much materiall he ſhould haue knowen it. He ought to haue beleeued his meſſage. It ſeemeth he knew not thoroughly, that he was an Angell, becauſe the Angell tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him, verſe, 19, that he ſo was.</p>
               <p>Only the meaning heere is, that Zachary ſpake, to him, who appeared and ſpake to him.</p>
               <p>If Zacharias did not know it was an Angel, marke that we had need looke to our ſpeeches. We ſpeake &amp; ſo doe many times, before greater perſonages, then we thinke for, looke
<pb facs="tcp:1866:198"/>1, Cor, 11, 10. for the Angels.</p>
               <p>If he knew it was an Angel, and did not forbeare, ſee the corruption of our hart, which cannot be kept in by the preſence of Angels.</p>
               <p>The thing is, that he ſaid.</p>
               <p>His ſpeaking need not to be ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>Onely marke in both, that euen Zachary could not reſt and ſettle himſelfe vpon the plaine, and bare word of God.</p>
               <p>So hard a thing is it, for euery of vs to doe the like, wee muſt all be queſtioning and moouing more ſpeech. It was not ſo with Eli, Ezechias.</p>
               <p>That which he ſaid, was, <hi>Whereby ſhall I know this? For I am, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is of doubting, wherein hee demaundeth a ſigne, and ſheweth that he hath reaſon ſo to doe.</p>
               <p>He demandeth a ſigne, in ſaying, <hi>whereby,</hi> that is, by what ſigne, <hi>ſhall I know this?</hi> He ſheweth his reaſon in the other words following.</p>
               <p>Now to demaunde a ſigne, may not ſeeme to be ſimply vnlawfull, for Gedion did it twice. Iudg. 6, 37, 39, So did Abraham, Gene, 15, 8.</p>
               <p>And Moſes couertly, Exod, 4, 1, and Ezechias, Eſay, 38, 22.</p>
               <p>And yet crauing this ſigne, he is not onely rebuked, but corrected for it.</p>
               <p>For better cleering whereof, know that a ſigne in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is deſired two waies.</p>
               <p>Either for to
<list>
                     <item>beget</item>
                     <item>increaſe</item>
                  </list> fayth.</p>
               <p>To beget faith, the Iewes deſire a ſigne, and are rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, becauſe they did not, nor would not belieue without.</p>
               <p>To increaſe faith, did Abraham and Gedion deſire a ſigne. For it is witneſſed of Abraham that hee did belieue. Gene, 15, 6.</p>
               <p>Zachary did deſire a ſigne in the former ſort, and is iuſtly puniſhed therefore.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:1866:198"/>
               <p> It is worth the marking, that Maries ſpeech dooth not much differ from this. Looke Luke 1, 34, &amp; yet her mind was farre differing from Zacharias.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Marke that likeneſſe of ſpeech, doth not alwaies argue likeneſſe of diſpoſition.</p>
               <p n="2">2 We hardly belieue Gods bare word.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It is a ſinne not to belieue the word without a ſigne. Therefore Papiſts wrong themſelues, when they require miracles for our doctrine.</p>
               <p>He ſheweth he hath ſome ſhew of reaſon to demaund a ſigne, <hi>for I am an old man, &amp;c.</hi> And heere it is well, that Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary remembreth his condition, as wee all ſhould, old or young, that we are mortall.</p>
               <p>But euill it is that Zachary abuſeth the courſe of nature, to impeach and weaken the power of God: as wee many times doe.</p>
               <p>Thus farre the demaunde or occaſion: now followeth the matter of the anſwer. verſe 19, 20.
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋerſe, </seg>19</label> All which is to ſhew Zacharias, that he had no cauſe to doubt, &amp; that he ſhould haue a ſigne.</p>
               <p>But firſt marke, the Angell doth not ſhake of Zacharie, and giue ouer further conference vppon his vnbeliefe, but yet vouchſafed to continue ſpeech. So good is God to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man, ſo kind ſhould wee be in our charge, when there is no ſinning wilfully, to follow and conuince all wee can.</p>
               <p>Now the Angell ſheweth, that Zacharie hath no cauſe to ſuſpect him of falſhood, from his nature, office, &amp; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>Nature, for that hee is an Angell, as appeareth by his name, office, and calling in the reſt.</p>
               <p>No good Angell will, or indeede can lye, I am ſuch an one: therefore.</p>
               <p>That hee is ſuch an one, appeareth by his name, <hi>I am,</hi> that is, I am called <hi>Gabriell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Marke firſt, if Angels words be true, much more Gods.</p>
               <p>The Angell telleth his name, to ſhew that theſe are a part of thoſe matters, that were before expounded by this
<pb facs="tcp:1866:199"/>Angel, to Daniell in his prophecie, and ſo to get the more credit.</p>
               <p>VVhere one would maruaile, that a man ſeene in the Scriptures (as it is like Zacharias was) could be ignorant of this: but ſuch are we moſt of vs.</p>
               <p>Queſt. Haue Angels names? Looke Tremellius notes on the Syriac Paraphraſe in this place, and on Iunius vpon Tob, 12, 15. Aun. I thinke they haue not, for indeed it is not needfull, God and themſelues, knowing them, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing them well enough.</p>
               <p>And though GOD be ſaid to call the ſtarres by theyr names, the meaning is, that God knoweth them euery one, and hath them at his commandement. So as when Angels are named, it is but for our capacitie.</p>
               <p>The office is, that he is <hi>ſtanding in the preſence of God.</hi> It is a ſpeech taken from men, ſhewing ſpeciall fauour to theyr attendants.</p>
               <p>The Angell heereby meaneth, that hee is not the baſeſt euen among the Angels.</p>
               <p>The Angels thinke no ſcorne to ſerue God: 2 they are very diligent.</p>
               <p>Though the phraſe, meant, hee is wont to ſtand in the immediat preſence of God, yet we may learne, euen in our places we are before God.</p>
               <p>The force of the reaſon is this, I am in very chiefe place, therefore I doe not lie. Whereby he teacheth, the greater his place is, the leſſer ſhould his ſin be.</p>
               <p>His calling is, that he is <hi>ſent,</hi> and that with his meſſage.</p>
               <p>Sending, is commaundement from lawfull authoritie to goe.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The Angel came not without ſending, no more muſt any.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Angell beeing ſent in matters of the Goſpel, did not diſdaine: men ſhould not think theyr ſonnes too good to be Miniſters.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Men may preſume they are ſent, when they haue a gift, and their vſe thereof is required by lawfull authority.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:1866:199"/>
               <p> The meſſage was to ſpeake, and to tell theſe glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
               <p>The Angell would not ſpeake without Gods direction, we muſt doe nothing without the ſame.</p>
               <p>Euen ſpeech is a good mercy of God.</p>
               <p>Our harts muſt needs be dull, when they will not belieue glad tydings for themſelues.</p>
               <p>Hetherto that Zacharias had no cauſe to doubt, now followeth touching his demanding a ſigne, which in ſome ſort is granted. For, himſelfe is the ſigne.</p>
               <p>Where we ſee, that a man in ſome ſort may haue his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and be neuer the better, as Lot, Geneſis, 13. Baruch, Iudg, 4.</p>
               <p>So as that it is not good, to let our ſelues looſe to by and rouing deſires: but onely to hang vpon God.</p>

               <p>The narration is in the reſt, and telleth Zachary of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection which he is like to haue. So as,</p>
               <p>The godly are ſubieſt to the croſſe. Not to diſcharge puniſhments otherwiſe to be ſuffered afterward: but,</p>
               <p n="1">1 To bring them to ſee theyr ſinnes: 2 To ſeeke for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of them in Chriſt. 3 To take heede of them for afterward. 4 To exerciſe their faith, and repentance, ſtir them vp to prayer, humiliation, compaſſion, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So as that when we haue any croſſe, wee ſhould vſe it to theſe ends.</p>
               <p>Of this croſſe are noted the

               <p n="1">1 So as wee muſt acknowledge ſpeech to be the gift of

               <p n="2">2 That God can puniſh like fault with like correction. He that belieueth not the word, ſhall not ſpeake, hee that harkneth not to Gods word, ſhall ſpeake none of his own. &amp;c. Take heede then of ſinne, for as euery ſinne hath his baite, ſo hath it a whip.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That God in the midſt of puniſhments is mercifull. He leaueth to Zachary his hearing, ſeeing, vnderſtanding, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>There is none of vs, but in our greateſt croſſes, wee may obſerue many mercies of God towards vs, ſo as wee ought to forbeare murmuring, and exaggerating our griefes.</p>
               <p>The continuance is, <hi>vntill the day that, &amp;c.</hi> This was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer or vnder tenne months.</p>
               <p>So as the croſſe continueth ſometimes ſomewhile vpon Gods children, this could not be but great, that Zacharias ſpeech, which was wont to be vſed in profitable matters, for teaching his houſhold, for prayer, for conference, ſhould be reſtrained: yet ſo it is.</p>

               <p n="2">2 And get more ſpirituall prouiſion for the bearing of them.</p>
               <p>Now God limiteth this time, to make Zachary as deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of a ſonne, as hee was diſtruſtfull, when one was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Not to belieue, is not to belieue the truth.</p>

               <p>Thus far the Angels ſpeech alone: now follow certaine
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1866:200"/>euents with it, and vpon it. verſe 21, 22, 23. And thoſe are three, 1 Zacharias tarying in the Temple, ver, 21, 2 His dumbneſſe, verſe 22. 3 His going home, ver, 23.</p>
               <p>Zacharias tarrying is firſt ſet downe, in that it is ſaid, <hi>hee tarried in the Temple.</hi> Secondly, it is ſet out, 1 by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples wayting, 2 by theyr admiration.</p>
               <p>In the ſetting downe, are the perſon, place, of both which we haue ſpoken before.</p>
               <p>The thing is <hi>tarrying,</hi> that is continuance of time, more then vſuall. The vſuall time was, while the incenſe vvas burnt. This when God otherwiſe would, Zacharias did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede.</p>

               <p>So as men muſt not at all times, tye ſuch exerciſe to the ſame ſtint of time.</p>
               <p>Nor blame theyr Zachariaſſes, if they ſometimes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue longer then at other times.</p>
               <p>Marke alſo that ſometimes good cuſtomes may be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled, by an higher commaundement of God.</p>
               <p>Zacharias tarrying, is firſt ſet out, by that <hi>the people way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>The people,</hi> as before, many together.</p>
               <p>Wayting, was theyr tarrying till he came.</p>
               <p>Which they ought to haue done, for that Zacharias was buſie with God for them.</p>
               <p>So as though all muſt be diligent, yet if there ſhould be any wayting, people (in matters of diuine worſhip) ſhould waite for Miniſters, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Miniſters for people. Looke Cornelius his fact, Acts, 10, 24.</p>
               <p>And indeede for people that haue not prepared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues at home, timely repayring to the aſſemblies, may ſupply domeſticall wanting preparation.</p>
               <p>Men attend vpon Lawyers and Phyſitians, though they pray and pay.</p>
               <p>Note beſides, that the people departed not, though Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias
<pb facs="tcp:1866:201"/>tarried longer then ordinarie.</p>
               <p>It is a fault in people, when Miniſters at ſet times are faine to attend vpon the people, till they come.</p>
               <p>As alſo when the people depart, before the aſſembly be orderly diſmiſſed.</p>
               <p>The peoples wondring noteth, 1 That they thought it a ſtrange thing. So as Zacharias did not vſe to breake good cuſtomes, no more ſhould we.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As that the people did not haſtily blame Zacharias for long tarrying, no more ſhould we.</p>

<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe, </seg>22</label> verſe, 22. And this is ſet downe ſhortly, and more largely.</p>
               <p>Shortly in two degrees, 1 That he was dumbe. 2 Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued dumbe. And of both theſe, ſomewhat was ſpoken before.</p>
               <p>The larger ſetting downe of theſe, is in three poynts: 1 From the preſentnes. 2 The occaſion. 3 The effect.</p>
               <p>The preſentneſſe, that <hi>as ſoone as euer hee came out, hee could not ſpeake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So as wee muſt be perſwaded of Gods almighty power, who can ſay, and doe, and feare his threatnings, leaſt they fall preſently vpon vs.</p>
               <p>Queſt. Why is his dumbneſſe at his comming out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</p>
               <p>Aun. For that eyther he ſhould haue vſed ſome ſpeech of edification vnto them, or made ſome defence for his long tarrying, or diſſolued the aſſembly with the bleſſing. Numb. 6, 23.</p>
               <p>The occaſion is ſeeing a viſion. And this is noted to be knowne by the people, and to haue been in the Temple.</p>
               <p>Viſion is a ſight, one of the meanes whereby God ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelfe vnto his people.</p>
               <p>This was ſometimes to the minde, ſometimes to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and eyes. As heere in this place. For it is moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Angell appeared in ſome viſible ſhape.</p>
               <p>Now theſe viſions were of ſpeciall fauour, and not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:1866:201"/>
               <p> So doth God grace his children, bewraying himſelfe more familiarly to his children then others, if not by ſuch viſions, yet by the word and worke of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>So as the godly ſhould comfort themſelues in their eſtate, and the wicked haue no cauſe to contemne them.</p>
               <p>Queſt. Are we now to looke for ſuch viſions?</p>
               <p>Aun. No. For Chriſt is he in whom God hath ſpoken to vs. Only the viſions we are to looke at, are in the word and Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Luther ſaith notably, that if God ſhould offer him a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to confirme him in the truth of his doctrine, he would refuſe it, he had ſuch euidence for it in the word.</p>
               <p>This viſion the people <hi>perceiued</hi> that Zacharias ſaw.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>perceiuing,</hi> in the Greeke is, <hi>knew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To know is without dieceit to perceiue. This perceiuing is

                     <item>probable.</item>

               </p>
               <p>Probable is heere vnderſtood; for the people might haue beene deceiued.</p>
               <p>Ob. Zachary might haue ſeene ſome euill ſight, which might thus haue affected him.</p>
               <p>Aun. True: yet Zacharias godlineſſe made them thinke the beſt of him. So as,</p>
               <p>Godlineſſe purchaſeth credit where it is.</p>
               <p>Men ought to preſume the beſt of godly men.</p>
               <p>This viſion was <hi>in the Temple.</hi> Which may incourage vs to ſerue God in our places, for then God will one way or other ſhew himſelfe fauourable vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the effect wherby is proued Zacharias dumneſſe.</p>
               <p>For proferring to ſpeake he could not, but was faine to vſe ſignes.</p>
               <p>Ob. One may thinke that Zacharias finding his vnabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to ſpeake, was vnaduiſed to vſe ſignes, to his owne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit, which could not otherwiſe be in ſome of the people, and did not rather withdraw himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Aun. Men muſt not when God is to be glorified, though it be to their owne ſhame ſeeke ſhiftes, and cloakes.</p>

               <p>Leturgie, ſignifieth any publique ſeruice: looke Rom: 13, 6.</p>
               <p>The matter is behind.</p>
               <p>It may be demanded, how many dayes his office laſted?</p>
               <p>Aun. I thinke ſeauen, as may be gathered 2, King, 11, 9.</p>
               <p>Sure it is, that Zacharias did not depart, before they were run out.</p>
               <p>Ob. How could Zacharias diſcharge the Prieſts office, lacking ſpeech?</p>
               <p>Aun. Others ſupplied the duties of ſpeech, he did that he could, to looke to the lights, incenſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So as we muſt be willing to doe what we can, when we cannot doe as we ſhould.</p>
               <p>As ſure it is when the dayes were ouer, that then he went as to refreſh himſelfe after his labours, ſo to fit himſelfe by ſtudy for afterward, as alſo to doe the duties in his priuate family.</p>
               <p>So as that Magiſtrats, Miniſters, and others in place, are to haue conuenient refreſhings.</p>
               <p>Now for the better vnderſtanding of his going home we muſt know, that,</p>
               <p n="1">1 The publique worſhip of God, was to be performed at Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Prieſts did not all dwell there.</p>
               <p n="3">3 They came from their owne houſes, and had chambers about the Temple, that they might be neerer to their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, Neh: 13.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:1866:203"/>
               <p> So haue our termers towards Weſtminſter.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts gather from hence that Prieſts ſhould haue no wiues, as well might they ſay no houſes, and ſay the like of our Lawyers, who goe to London to the terme.</p>
               <p>Zacharias houſe was in the hill countrie of Iudea, a mile from Emaus.</p>
               <p>For better vnderſtanding heerof, know that, the Leuits had 48 cities: the ſuburbes, 2000 cubites, which is a good mile on euery ſide, ſo as they might keepe cattell, plant, haue gardens, walkes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Hence appeereth that they had ſufficient, certaine, and ſuch maintenance, where-with ſome few were not charged, nor the Prieſts beholding to ſome, but it was the common charge, ſo were the Prieſts freer. Thus ſhould it be alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs.</p>
               <p>Hetherto haue beene ſuch things, as the Spirit of God thought good to ſet downe before the conception of Iohn,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe, </seg>24</label> now followeth the conception it ſelfe in part of verſe, 24. <hi>And after thoſe dayes his wife Eliſabet conceiued.</hi> And heere is nothing hard: the perſon <hi>his wife Eliſabet,</hi> hath beene ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before.</p>
               <p>The thing, <hi>conceiued,</hi> few are ignorant of: the meaning is, ſhee had the materiall beginnings of Iohn in her. This indeede was the more ſtrange for her age.</p>
               <p>Yet no word with God is impoſſible.</p>
               <p>The laſt is the noting of time, <hi>after thoſe dayes.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Theſe dayes are noted by <hi>thoſe.</hi>

               <p>Thus much for the conception, the third and laſt about the conception that remaineth, is heere noted to be in things which fell out thereupon.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And heere the perſon neede not be ſpoken of. The thing is her hiding of her ſelfe. The word in the originall ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth very ſecret hiding as round about.</p>
               <p>Hiding is comming in leſſe company then ordinary.</p>
               <p>All women ſhould leſſe come in company then men, they muſt not gad, but keepe houſe. Shee now kept more cloſe then women, and then her ſelfe was wont.</p>
               <p>It is like ſhee did not this without liking of her houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
               <p>Only the time may a little be thought of, <hi>fiue months.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A month is heere to be taken as women in their matters vſe to count a month.</p>
               <p>Queſt. But why fiue? Aun. Diuers anſwere diuerſlly. Piſcator thinketh it hard to be told why: Beza alledgeth three cauſes, either for that all Iewiſh women vſed to doe ſo, or did miſdoubt whether it would fall ſo yea or no, or hiding her ſelfe ſo long, and then comming abroade on the ſuddaine, the wonder might ſeeme the greater.</p>
               <p>Chemnicius, for that ſhee was aſhamed to be thought to haue luſt now in her old age, as Sara, Gen: 18, 12.</p>
               <p>I may craue leaue to ſpeake my mind. It was, I take, it that ſhee might at her firſt comming abroad, be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince that ſhe was with child.</p>
               <p>Diuers doe marke other mens wiues.</p>
               <p>Some haue ſhewed to others and ſeemed to others to haue beene with child, and were not, as Queene Mary. This is by a timpany or mole.</p>
               <p>Now it is and was more a blemiſh among the Iewes to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1866:204"/>count of children before they had them.</p>
               <p>It is receiued that at fiue moneths end (though indeed it be before) the child is quick. Therefore ſhe tarried till then, according to the opinion of wemen, that the childe beeing quicke, might euidently confirme to her that ſhe was with child. A month after, it ſprang ſtrangely.</p>
               <p>And heere haue we example of good diſcretion and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane weakeneſſe.</p>
               <p>Diſcretion, in that ſhee was willing to preuent fooliſh ſpeeches and ieſtes, ſo ſhould we doe, and looke warilie to our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Of weakeneſſe, for that it ſeemed ſhee feared more then ſhee needed, hauing Gods promiſe, and hauing doone no fault. This muſt we take heede of. Many for want of finer apparrell, come not to Church. This is a fault.</p>
               <p>Her ſpeech is, that ſhe ſaid, and what.</p>
               <p>It may be queſtioned. Whether ſhee ſpake in her owne hart, or other folkes eares?</p>
               <p>Aun. Yet ſhe came not abroad, it was but therefore to herſelfe, or in her houſe.</p>
               <p>Sure it is ſhee marked Gods fauourable dealing toward her: ſo muſt we.</p>
               <p>That which ſhe ſaith is, <hi>her acknowledging of Gods goodnes to her,</hi> ver, 25. Where ſhe noted the kind of the benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, the giuer, the time.</p>

               <p>The giuer is <hi>the Lord,</hi> that is God. Who indeede giueth all good things, and is to be acknowledged the Authour thereof, and the ſtranger the thing is, the more. Men muſt not therefore onely maruaile, or ieſt at a ſtrange thing, but giue God the praiſe.</p>
               <p>She increaſeth the benefit, by ſaying, <hi>he hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away my

               <p>Gods children take to hart ſuch things.</p>
               <p>God when pleaſeth him, relieueth his children euen in theſe things, ſo as we muſt waite vpon him.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing that the world laieth that, as a ſhame to a man which is not his fault, it may be borne the better.</p>
               <p>This rebuke was among men or women, who in this kinde moſt rebuke one another.</p>

               <p>God looketh to all his creatures by his prouidence, to his children in ſpeciall loue.</p>

               <p>To be curious to ſearch times we muſt not, Act: 1, 7, but God bewraying times, we muſt take knowledge of them, and euen of leſſe matters.</p>
               <p>So as the Iewes, and whoſoeuer not beleeuing this, do ſin greeuouſly.</p>
               <p>This time is <hi>the ſixt month.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Month is to be vnderſtood according to the mind of the writer, and the order of the countrie which he meaneth.</p>
               <p>Luke ſpeaketh heere, after the account of Iewes.</p>
               <p>The Iewes had in a yeare months (thought otherwiſe differing from the Iulian) in number, 12. The firſt Niſan, anſwering to March, and ſo forward. Though the order of the number of dayes be not alike.</p>
               <p>So that a month heere is the twelft part of the Sunnes yeare, month is of the Moones motion, ſo as we may ſee that verified, Gen: 1, 14. Gods people can vſe the ſtarres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right for times and not for iudiciall Aſtrologie.</p>
               <p>This month is ſaid to be <hi>the ſixt.</hi> Sixt is a note of order, for as the beginning from whence one accounteth is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe, ſo may be the ſixt month.</p>
               <p>It may be demanded, whence one ſhould beginne to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to number this moneth the ſixt?</p>
               <p>Aun. Sure it is that among the Iewes, there were two manners of reckning the month of the yeare. For, for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious vſes and feſtiuall times they counted Niſan the firſt,
<pb facs="tcp:1866:206"/>and ſo forward, but for ciuill, they counted the ſeauenth the firſt. Looke Tremellius on Exod, 2, at the third verſe.</p>
               <p>But I take it, that in neither of theſe reſpects the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt thus writeth, but onely in reſpect of the former narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Meaning that it was ſixe months after that the like meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage had beene brought to Zachary.</p>
               <p>Indeede it was in the firſt month of the yeere, ſo to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for religious vſes. For ſixe months before to Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie in the other beginning was that meſſage done.</p>
               <p>Now then counting from the annunciation to this, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to haue beene in Abib or Niſan, anſwering partly our March, ſo as yet Chriſtians keepe this feaſt, 25. Martij.</p>
               <p>Now ſurely it is worth the marking, that the Annuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Zachary, was in the beginning of the ciuill, and this to Mary of the religious or eccleſiaſticall yeere.</p>
               <p>Queſt. But why was it iuſt ſixe months after?</p>
               <p>Aun. I thinke, that not onely in preaching, but in bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing borne, and euen conceiued, Iohn might appeare to be a fore-runner of Chriſt: as that there might be thought no confederacie, the one comming ſo neere the other in time.</p>
               <p>Que. Was the ſixt moneth ending or beginning?</p>
               <p>Aun. Ending.</p>
               <p>Learne by the former that one may goe before in time, and come behind in grace, as Iohn did in reſpect of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>So as that none of vs ſhould prefer our ſelues aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, onely in reſpect of age.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And that Iohn though hee were Chriſtes elder in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie conception, yet ſeeing greater graces of GOD in him then in himſelfe, preferred Chriſt before himſelfe, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what we ſhould doe likewiſe.</p>
               <p>The perſon ſent, was <hi>the Angell Gabriell ſent from God.</hi> Where is his nature, name, and calling.</p>
               <p>Nature, <hi>Angell,</hi> as before in the 11. verſe.</p>
               <p>Que. Why was an Angell ſent, whereas the preaching of the word beeing a greater matter, is by men?</p>
               <p>Aun. The preaching of the Word is ordinarie, &amp; muſt be by ordinary meanes, this is extraordinary: as alſo for that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1866:206"/>Iſaacks, Sampſons birthes, were foretold by Angels, good reaſon then it was, that this much more ſhould be ſo, as from the beginning to ſtrike into the conſiderers minds greater reuerence.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Shall God ſend his Angels, ſhall not we be willing to ſend our children about Gods buſineſſe?</p>
               <p n="2">2 Or ſhall Angels be willing to goe, and we vnwilling?</p>
               <p n="3">3 Neither can it be choſen, but God loueth vs dearly who ſendeth his Angels.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And maketh high account of theſe matters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts his Angels goe.</p>
               <p>So as if we doe not heede them with all reuerence, we ſinne.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Gods ſending an Angell noteth his owne mightie power, who is euen ouer Angels, ſo as he can ſend them, and none but he. No creature hath authoritie to command an Angell good or bad, but God.</p>
               <p>So as that euen Witches can not ſend euill ſpirits, but by the ſufferance of God.</p>
               <p>The Fathers often write this Angell, Archangell, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great warrant.</p>
               <p>The Angels name is <hi>Gabriell,</hi> as before, verſe, 19.</p>
               <p>Tremellius noteth on the 1 Luck: that Angels are not named in the old teſtament before the peoples comming out of captiuitie, yea, before, though they were asked of their names, they concealed.</p>
               <p>After the captiuitie they are called by names.</p>
               <p>We muſt take heede of curioſity, to ſearch no further then God hath made knowen. The Rabbins haue diuers names for Angels good and bad, they ſay, he who tempted Eue was called Samaell, &amp;c. Munſt: on Math:</p>
               <p>Theſe things are needleſſe.</p>
               <p>Let vs know that Angels though they be neuer ſo many, are knowen a ſunder of God; and are but ſeruants of God, not our Lords to be worſhipped.</p>
               <p>The calling followeth, <hi>ſent of God,</hi> as is before, verſe, 19. Where is noted the perſon, &amp; thing: Perſon, <hi>God</hi> ſending:
<pb facs="tcp:1866:207"/>
                  <hi>God,</hi> the whole Trinitie.</p>
               <p>This which is ſaid of the Angell, is true of any rightly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his dutie.</p>
               <p>So as men had neede take heede how they refuſe ſuch as are ſent, the contempt redoundeth to the ſender. Men ſent, muſt make conſcience, as comming from God, and withall, not doubt of good ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>This made the Galathians ſo well to thinke of Paule.</p>
               <p>The thing is <hi>ſent, Sent</hi> implieth furniſhed with a gift, called vpon to vſe the gift.</p>
               <p>Gift is abilitie to doe a duty. One is called vpon, when ones hart is ſtirred vp to vſe this gift, and others for whoſe vſe it is, require the ſame.</p>
               <p>So as none muſt preſume themſelues to be ſent in whom theſe are not.</p>
               <p>In whom theſe are, they may haue comfort that they are ſent.</p>
               <p>The Angell preſently ſent was able to doe his duty. So ſhould we all be furniſhed, not to learne when we ſhould practiſe our duties.</p>
               <p>The place followeth, and firſt generally, afterward ſpecially.</p>
               <p>The generall place is a <hi>cittie of Galilee, called Nazareth.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The higher, is called Galilee of the Gentiles, not only as Tremellius thinketh, popular, but for that till Solomons time Gentils dwelt in it, or for that Solomon gaue 20 cities in it, to Hiram a Gentile 1 King, 9, 11, or for that it was vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1866:207"/>of Paleſtine, and neereſt the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>In this did Chriſt much preach, as Eſay, 9, 1, Math: 4, 15.</p>
               <p>In the lower was Nazareth.</p>
               <p>Not much is written of Galilee, for that the people of God had not much to doe with others, we may ſee there was a Tetrarch of it. Luk: 3, 1.</p>
               <p>One might haue thought, that Italie, or ſome other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, might haue beene choſen, eſpecially conſidering Ioh: 7, 52, and that one writeth,

               <p>And indeed ſo ſaid Iulian the Apoſtata, <hi>Thou haſt ouercome me O Galilean,</hi> to Chriſt.</p>

               <p>Nathaniell thought that no good thing could come out of Nazareth, Ioh, 1, 46, and yet Chriſt was conceiued there.</p>
               <p>No doubt the towne in former time had beene ſo euilly diſpoſed, as that it had diſcredited it ſelfe for afterwards.</p>
               <p>One would haue thought that Hieruſalem had beene a fit place for the mother of Chriſt to dwell. But marke,</p>

               <p>The perſon to whom the Angell was ſent,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe, </seg>27</label> was <hi>a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgine, affianced to a man whoſe name was Ioſeph, of the houſe of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, and the Virgins name was Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt marke is, that ſhe is <hi>a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin.</hi> A Virgin is of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie, Virginitie is chaſtitie in neuer-maried life.</p>
               <p>Though it be meant ſhe was a Virgin, before this her being with child, yet is it very probably to be thought, that ſhe was ſo afterward for euer, in that it is to be thought that ſoe choſen a veſſell for ſuch a purpoſe, was kept holy for euer vnto the Lord.</p>
               <p>Ob. 1 Chriſt is ſaid to haue brothers and ſiſters. Aun. That is according to the Hebrew phraſe, kinsfolke.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Vntill may ſeeme to note knowledge for afterward. Aun. Vntill is many times put for, for euer Math: 28, 20.</p>
               <p>Some enquire whether ſhe were a vowed Virgin or no, and Papiſts thinke that ſhe was vowed. But it is not likely, for that no ſuch vowes were in vſe among the Iewes, and ſhe was betrothed, with purpoſe to haue ſolemnized ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Math, 1, 18. It was a blemiſh to Iewiſh Virgins not to marry. Therefore is it noted there Virgins were not praiſed, Iepthes daughter was mourned for being a Virgin, and a woman was not thought to haue reſt, till ſhe had an husband. The Iewes did highly magnify mariage.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:1866:208"/>
               <p> Others ſet downe her age, about 15 or 16 yeeres: that is not ſure, certaine it is ſhe was not old.</p>
               <p>And that ſhee was a virgin, Eſay noteth, 7, 14, which the Iewes with all theyr gloſſes cannot deface. It is noted as a wonder, it hath the letter <hi>He</hi> of notice, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And very expedient was it that ſhe ſhould be a Virgin. 1 That Chriſt might not be gotten by ſinfull man, 2 and might not haue two fathers.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Now whatſoeuer be heere noted of Mary for virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, none muſt fondly affect virginitie, ſhe was extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and had a gift, others with whom it is not ſo, ought to marry.</p>
               <p n="2">2 She beeing young, wee may note a patterne of rare grace and godlineſſe in corrupted times.</p>
               <p n="3">3 We ſhall neuer ſpiritually co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue Chriſt in our harts, vnleſſe we be pure virgins to God, hauing nothing to doe with loue of ſin.</p>
               <p>The ſecond marke is, that ſhe <hi>was affianced to a man whoſe name was Ioſeph. &amp;c.</hi> VVhere is noted her diſpoſition to marriage, and the partie to whom.</p>
               <p>Her diſpoſition is, <hi>affianced. Affianced</hi> is, as wee ſpeake, betrothed or contracted.</p>
               <p>Some make two ſorts of affiancing: 1 Promiſed barely for marriage: 2 Giuen to marriage, but not knowne.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts vnderſtand the latter here, though onely the former be meant, as may appeare, Math, 1, 18.</p>
               <p>Queſt. Why was ſhe betrothed?</p>
               <p>Aun. 1 For the honour of marriage: 2 to auoyde all iuſt blame among the Iewes: 3 that ſhe might haue ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard &amp; ſuccour in flying to Egypt: 4 that none by her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample might haue colour of vnchaſtitie: 5 Some ſay, that the deuill might not know the conception of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This her beeing affianced, was according to the word of God, as may appeare in the old Teſtament, and according to the order in the Church of God, &amp; is very requiſite, not onely, 1 for the further increaſing of loue: 2 and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to matrimoniall duties: 3 but that ſuch a ſtrait knot,
<pb facs="tcp:1866:209"/>might be leyſurely tied: 4 So as if any thing were to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, it might in time be preuented before conſummation: 5 as alſo that men and women might with the more graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and reuerence come together, not as Beaſtes, or birdes, which chooſe their makes, and company preſently.</p>
               <p>Queſt. What is affiancing? Aun. It is a promiſe law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, mutuall, voluntarie, of mariage, between a man and a woman marrageable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A promiſe,</hi> I take, to be a manifeſt preſent bewraying of the mind to doe a thing, by words, writing, or deedes, or ſignes preſent: ſo as that it is not enough to haue a purpoſe or intent, wiſh, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A forme whereof may be this, I promiſe to take thee in marriage, or I take thee for my eſpouſed, or promiſed, or betrothed.</p>
               <p>It muſt be <hi>lawfull,</hi> by Gods lawes, and mens lawes. This ſtretcheth very farre.</p>
               <p>Marriage by Gods law muſt be: 1 in the Lord: 2 ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued by conſent of Parents, if there be any.</p>
               <p>Mans good lawes muſt be kept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mutuall,</hi> is of each to other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>oluntary,</hi> requireth that it be not compelled, each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie muſt be willing, and cheerefull with it.</p>
               <p>The thing that affiancing reſpecteth, is marriage. It is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betwixt two perſons. <hi>Marrageable,</hi> are ſuch as for age, religion, kinred, &amp;c. may lawfully marry.</p>
               <p>Now this affiancing ſhould be. 1 with reuerence in the preſence of God, and calling vpon his name: 2 and before godly and faithfull witneſſes.</p>
               <p>There is no time appointed in the word betweene affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancing and marrying: onely good orders in Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thrice publiſhing.</p>
               <p>Two ſorts are heere to be blamed, 1 Who neglect to be affianced, whereas the practiſe is in the word of GOD. 2 Who cloſely without due reuerence or witneſſe, contract themſelues.</p>
               <p>The party to whom ſhe was affianced for ſexe, <hi>a man,</hi> for
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1866:209"/>name was <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> for blood <hi>of the houſe of Dauid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is needleſſe to ſpeake of the ſignification of the name, whereof looke Gene, 30, 24, or to ſhew that names of good men are recorded in ſcriptures, to teach vs that they are not forgotten with God, and that ſuch names ſhould be giuen, which may put in minde ſome good thing.</p>
               <p>This Ioſeph is noted for a good man, of an honeſt trade of life, though poore. With ſuch, according to our places, ſhould we be willing in marriage to match.</p>
               <p>His blood, <hi>of Dauids houſe,</hi> that is, line. This is added to note the ſtock of Mary. For the Tribes were kept diſtinct, and married within themſelues, ſaue that of Leui, and to ſhew the fulfilling of Gods promiſe to Dauid.</p>
               <p>But marke how God fulfilleth his promiſe, hee keepeth and performeth the ſpirituall and beſt of it, the other is not materiall.</p>
               <p>Dauids kingly outward eſtate, dooth not heere appeare. Ioſeph was but poore.</p>
               <p>Marke 1 that houſes decay: 2 and that Ioſeph of a great houſe, beeing in pouertie, ſtandeth not vpon his blood, but falleth to ſome honeſt labour, ſo ſhould we in like caſe.</p>
               <p>The third marke is her name. <hi>Mary,</hi> the ſame with <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam</hi> in Hebrew, and the old Teſtament. The ſignification and cauſe of giuing are not hard to be found.</p>
               <p>There were diuers Maries. Heere no difference is made, for that ſhe was very well knowne, and need not further to be ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>Now the Angell is further made knowne, by his going in to Mary, by his ſpeech, by that which fell out therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, namely, her feare.</p>
               <p>Going in to her, noteth the place, and the Angels bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where ſhe was.</p>
               <p>Queſt. Where is it likely that was? An. VVithin the houſe, in ſome priuate Chamber or cloſet. For women are willed, 2, Tim, 5, to keepe houſe: ſo is Sarah ſaide to haue beene in the Tent, Gene, 18, 9. And one who is often in the ſtreet, is noted in the Prouerbs of lightneſſe.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:210"/>
               <p> Mary therefore beeing a vertuous woman, ſure it is ſhee was within, &amp; no doubt praying, reading, or dooing ſome good thing.</p>
               <p>Heere note, that Parents ſhould keepe in their virgins. 2 That virgins themſelues ſhould be no gadders abroade: 3 That young men ſhould not intrude into Virgins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. 4 That when virgins are in the houſe, they ſhould ſpend the time about ſome profitable buſineſſe, not onely be tricking vp themſelues, &amp;c. 5 Laſtly, that beſtowing our ſelues well at home, Gods Angels will find vs out, and wee ſhall be ſure not to want the preſence of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the Angels going to Mary, now follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his ſpeech, &amp; is to verſe 37. and is of ſaluation, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, of particuler meſſage, of aunſwer.</p>
               <p>That of ſalutation,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe, </seg>28</label> is verſe 28. VVhere firſt we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue the abuſe, and then conſider the things which wee are to leaure thereby.</p>
               <p>The abuſe among the Papiſts of this place is great.</p>
               <p>Luther ſaid, the Lords prayer was a great Martyr, it is much more true of the <hi>Hatle Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The abuſes which we will note, are,</p>
               <p n="1">1 That it is patched vp together, by fetching from other places, as <hi>bleſſed is the fruite of thy wombe,</hi> by adding the name <hi>Mary, Ieſus, Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 That the ſimple are abuſed by the tranſlation of <hi>full of grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 That co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to all warrant it is appointed in ſuch ſort, as is among the Papiſts, to be vſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That it is appointed as a prayer. Whereas wee ſhould no otherwiſe vſe it then the Angell, who vſed it in ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as alſo for that the words themſelues are of ſalutation.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, it is of thankſgiuing, and ſo may be in kind of a prayer.</p>
               <p>Aun. It is not. And if it ſhould be of thankes, it ſhould be to God.</p>
               <p>Stapleton addeth, it may be a prayer by way of inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1866:210"/>as that, <hi>Behold, he whom thou loueſt is ſicke:</hi> and, <hi>If thou wilt, thou canst make me cleane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Aun. If it be a prayer, it muſt haue commaundement, and promiſe, it hath neither. And if it inſinuate, it muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate ſomewhat: heere is nothing.</p>
               <p>Ob. It may be vſed as a ſalutation. Aun. No. A ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ciuill, the Romaniſts appoint this to be vſed religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Againe ſalutations be to perſons preſent, the Virgin is abſent.</p>
               <p>Ob. Why may not ſhee as well be preſent in ſpirit, as Elizeus and Paule?</p>
               <p>Aun. Paules preſence was his allowance, Elizeus was an extraordinarie ſight, which when they ſhew in Mary, we will beleeue.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That it is ſo often repeated, eſpecially in their Roſaries and penances. That their ſhould be ten Auemaries to one Pater-noſter, and that 150 Auemaries, with 15, Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſters make a Ladies Pſalter.</p>
               <p>This is meere babling and lip-labour, not needing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confuration.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts are impious that abuſe Chriſts practiſe of thrice repeating the ſame, for theirs in this.</p>
               <p>As weake are the Rhemiſts and Stapletons reaſons, from the honor of the Virgin, for that this is the firſt meſſage of the incarnation, and is a ſumme of the Goſpell. All is falſe.</p>
               <p>Thus much for remouall of the abuſe: now followeth to conſider what we muſt learne thereby, which will appeare when we know the meaning thereof.</p>
               <p>This firſt branch hath, 1 Formes of ſalutations, to wit, <hi>Haile: The Lord with thee.</hi> 2 Titles in ſaluting, as, <hi>Freely beloued: Bleſſed among women.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that both are double, it teacheth that theſe things are not to be neglected.</p>
               <p>The former forme of ſalutation tranſlated <hi>Haile,</hi> might better be, <hi>reioyce,</hi> not only for agreeing with the originall, but to preuent ſuperſtitious curioſitie, ariſing out of the <hi>Latin</hi> Aue, for <hi>Eua</hi> and <hi>ſine-vae.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1866:211"/>
               <p> Salutations haue beene diuers, health, peace, ioy, proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Haile,</hi> is as much as health, as being a good gift of God: but heere it might more fitly be turned <hi>ioy</hi> or <hi>reioyce,</hi> &amp; the Angels ſpeech, the giuing of the ioy, which no doubt but he meant moſt hartily.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Marke the ſeruants of God are not rude and vnciuill, they neglect not ſo much as ſalutations.</p>
               <p n="2">2 They performe them hartily, not only in ſhew, as the greateſt part in the world now doe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 They haue good formes of ſalutation, not prophane as many haue.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And ſithens the Angell wiſheth ioy, we ſhould labour for true ioy, and euen holy reioycing in the fauour of God.</p>
               <p>The former title is, <hi>freely beloued,</hi> according to the Greek, as alſo Sa and Ianſenius iudge, whatſoeuer other Papiſts thinke of fulneſſe of grace, whereas in Chriſt onely is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>And ſure this was very fit, leaſt Mary might be puffed vp with conceit of her owne holineſſe.</p>
               <p>Now if Mary were freely beloued, who can deſerue? and if the Angell admoniſhed her thereof, it is good for vs to admoniſh one an other, and ſurely there is good vſe heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>To teach vs humility, and to make great account of the gifts of God.</p>
               <p>The latter forme of ſalutation is, <hi>the Lord with thee, is,</hi> or <hi>be.</hi> It was an vſuall manner of ſalutation among the Iewes. Iudges, 6, 12, Ruth: 2, 4, Pſal: 129, 8.</p>
               <p>And wiſheth all good. Now marke wherein is good, in that the Lord is with vs, that is, in euery ſort fauoureth vs.</p>
               <p>So as our ſelues muſt labour for this, muſt indeauour one to an other.</p>
               <p>And if this be wiſhed to Mary, much more had euery one of vs need thereof.</p>
               <p>This is ſaid of liuing, and to preſent, not of the dead.</p>
               <p>Euen our ordinary ſalutations ſhould ſauour of grace.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:1866:211"/>
               <p> The other title is bleſſed <hi>among women.</hi> The like is Iudg: 5, 24, that is, in compariſon, or aboue other women.</p>
               <p>This being bleſſed, ſignifieth that God doth fauour her in ſpeciall ſort. And that men doe praiſe and ſhall praiſe her. For ſo bleſſing &amp; being bleſſed in diuers reſpects doth ſignifie.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed of God, is fauoured of men, is praiſed.</p>
               <p>Now God did fauour her, not in giuing her onely ſauing grace, but in chooſing her to be the mother of God.</p>
               <p>The like fauours of God are we to acknowledge in our ſelues, and others.</p>
               <p>And though we doe not bodily beare Chriſt, yet if wee plant him or beare him in our harts by faith, it is a great mercy, which we muſt acknowledge in others, and in our ſelues.</p>
               <p n="2">2 God when it pleaſeth him, euen beſtoweth vppon his children true praiſe in the iudgement of his Church, ſo as we may know we ſhall haue it, if God thinke it good for vs. Otherwiſe, let vs not looke for it.</p>
               <p n="3">3 This acknowledging heereof in the Angell, ſheweth that there is a time when one may be put in minde of the true praiſe he hath: 1 True praiſe. For falſe, I take it, he is not to be acquainted with.</p>
               <p>That is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the partie told hath ſuch grace, as to aſcribe the glory to God. 2 When the thing prayſed, is a moſt excellent and manifeſt gift of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 When the partie prayſed, had neede to be hartened, &amp; incouraged in God.</p>
               <p n="4">4 When the partie prayſing, doth it, that GOD may haue the glory, not to flatter. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Women may learne what is theyr true praiſe. To haue fauour with GOD, and to conceiue Chriſt in theyr harts by faith, not their gay coates, and other tricks.</p>
               <p>The ſpeech of comfort followeth, 29, 30, ver:

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>AMong the ſundry duties in this Epiſtle, and other Scriptures, inioyned Chriſtians, this in this place is not leaſt, and ſhould not be laſt: which for that the ſeuerall words doe ſignifie diuerſly, is not all vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood alike of all, &amp; had need in generall to be cleered that way, before we can in due ſort profit thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trust,</hi> in the Greeke word is hope, and is taken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times properly, and other times vnproperly.</p>
            <p>Properly, it ſignifieth to looke or waite for a thing to come.</p>
            <p>Vnproperly, it is the ſame with belieue, truſt in a vvord, promiſe, or ſpeech: and the doubt heere is, which way we ſhould take it.</p>
            <p>Alſo <hi>grace,</hi> for ſound is a Latine word, of <hi>gratia,</hi> &amp; ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth fauour or liking, and is put, ſometimes for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of all good things from God to vs, as in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of diuers Epiſtles, <hi>Grace and peace:</hi> otherwhiles for ſome particuler loue token that commeth from thence.</p>
            <p>And that not yet after one ſort, for often it ſignifieth ſuch a loue token which we haue heere, which vſually is called grace: and more ſildome, for that which is afterward in the life to come, as in 1, Pet, 3, 7, it ſeemeth to be.</p>
            <p>Now, though it be certaine, that ſome ſpeciall loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken be heere moſt chiefely intented, yet all doe not agree, whether ſuch as is in this life, or afterward.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>brought,</hi> may be ſaid to be that which now is
<pb facs="tcp:1866:213"/>brought at the inſtant, and preſent time, or that vvhich ſhortly ſhall be.</p>
            <p>So Math, 3, 10, euery tree is ſaid <hi>to be hewed downe,</hi> for ſhal be hewed downe. And Reuel: 22, 20. <hi>I come quickly,</hi> for I will come quickly, becauſe hee will certainly come, and it will not be long ere hee come: ſo for grace brought, eyther now or afterward.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, <hi>reuelation of Christ,</hi> when Chriſt is reuealed, that is, gloriouſly at the laſt day, or when Chriſt reuealeth himſelfe by his word or Spirit, now in this life.</p>
            <p>The ſundry ſenſes of theſe wordes, haue cauſed that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers learned men haue thought diuers wayes of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and taken the meaning to be not the ſame.</p>
            <p>Some thus: Looke for the glory that ſhall ſhortly be brought vnto you, at the glorious appearing of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Others thus: Truſt on that preſent grace, that now is brought vnto you, by Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, reuealing and opening the ſame.</p>
            <p>Both are good, and agreeable to Scripture, and each haue the countenaunce of learned men. Yet one place can haue but one proper meaning. Neither muſt wee onelie care that interpretations be true, but that they be fit, and ſtand on theyr owne bottome.</p>
            <p>I iudge that the latter is the better.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe it more agreeth with the plainneſſe of the wordes, ſo as that ſcarce one is taken out of the owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſignification.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It is very rare, not twice (that I know) that grace is put for glory, as it ſhould be heere by ſome mens iudgements.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Seeing Peter had mentioned the laſt end before, verſe 4, 5, it is moſt likely that now heere hee ſhould ſet downe the way and meanes that bring thereto.</p>
            <p n="4">4 If the former ſhould be meant, then muſt the Apoſtle repeate that heere, which he had ſet downe aboue, verſe 7, which is not likely ſo ſoone, conſidering how ſhort and preſſe Peter in his writing is, without needleſſe tantologies.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:1866:213"/> 5 It ſeemeth that the order of his writing ſhould point to the later, for being afterward to intreat of obedience, he heere layeth a golden foundation of faith before, from whence the building of all good workes is to be reared.</p>
            <p n="6">6 And laſtly, the latter is the more fuller, for thorough, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe in grace, is a certaine pledge of glory: a man may looke for glory, and haue little grace, and if nothing els hinder we are to take ſcriptures in the largeſt meanings.</p>
            <p>The generall meaning thus being cleered, the drift &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of all, is to ſet out the excellencie and neceſſitie of truſt.</p>
            <p>And heere are two things to be conſidered: the one that, whereas endeauour is to be beſtowed, (for it muſt needs in nature be firſt, howſoeuer in words it be not ſoe) and the endeauour it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>That where about endeauour is to be beſtowed, is <hi>grace brought vnto you, by the reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The endeauour is, <hi>truſt perfectlie in</hi> or <hi>vpon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That where-about the indeauour is to be, is barely ſet downe, or further ſet out.</p>
            <p>Barely ſet downe, in that it is ſaid to be <hi>grace brought,</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſet out by the perſons to whom, <hi>you,</hi> by the manner how, <hi>by the reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The bare</hi> ſetting downe hath the kind of the thing, <hi>grace</hi> communicating of it in the word <hi>brought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grace</hi> is as before, flowing from the fountaine of all fauour and liking, and is ſome ſpeciall loue token from God to vs, as in ſundrie other places of ſcriptures. Ioh, 1, 16.</p>
            <p>Now this grace or fauour is not euery one, but ſome choiſe and ſpeciall, and is indeed that which Paule calleth to Tit: 2, 11, ſauing, or bringing ſaluation, neither can it be any other, for then would not the Apoſtle wiſh vs to truſt perfectly vpon it; for ſo ſhould we be deceiued, if we could not be ſaued.</p>
            <p>Now this grace of ſaluation is nothing but whereby we are recouered out of wretchedneſſe, and thraldome, to ſin, hell, and damnation, and reſtored into the fauour of God,
<pb facs="tcp:1866:214"/>in this life and for euer. Which now is not one only grace, but hath a ſtore-houſe indeed &amp; treaſury of all good graces in it.</p>
            <p>The choiſeſt Iewell of all, is Chriſt, God and man our Sauiour. For ſo is he called, Iohn, 3, 16, ſo God loued the world that he gaue his ſonne, not onlie as a gift, but (as the ſaying is, giue the beſt) the gift of gifts, in whom are hid all treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge, Col, 2, 3, the ſpirit without meaſure, Ioh, 1, 14, not only for himſelfe but for his Church. For of his fulneſſe we haue receiued grace for grace.</p>
            <p>And heere is firſt Chriſts office to be conſidered, our Prophet to teach vs the way to ſaluation, our Prieſt and ſacrifice to bring vs into the fauour of God, and to keepe vs therein, our King to keepe vs from all enemies, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to rule and order vs, that nothing hurt vs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the making knowen of this Chriſt by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Which as a ſpeciall fauour, Chriſt gaue after his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: looke Eph: 4, 8, 9, 10, the which likwiſe Paule ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth. Rom: 1, 5, and when God will ſhew his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to a pleople, he will not afford it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the wonderfull effects of this doctrine, where it is graciouſly bleſſed. As that we are reconciled to God, ſanctified in our ſelues, die to ſin, liue to righteouſnes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are ſo to be vnderſtood heere, as all and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for any thing beſides this grace marreth all, or any part waſting, defaceth all.</p>
            <p>Queſt. Are theſe only grace and not deſert?</p>
            <p>Aun. As we only reſpect our ſelues, the excellencie of the things, the great bountie of God, they are meere grace, yet if we reſpect Chriſt to God-ward, ſo are thy deſerts on Chriſts behalfe, and euen for vs.</p>
            <p>Hetherto the meaning, now a little for vſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, where the Apoſtle wiſheth vs to truſt in grace, let vs know that it is our part to abandon all other things, which are very many, that many truſt vpon, riches, wiſedom, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, outward profeſſion, good lawes, good Magiſtrats, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1866:214"/>ſuch like.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that euerlaſting ſaluation, &amp; euery gift tending thereto, is a meere grace and fauour, ſo as that whoſoeuer wanteth any, muſt ſeeke to God, and who ſo hath, muſt praiſe him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſo are they to be vnderſtood to be fauours, as not only beginning them, but to continuing, otherwiſe then ſome teach, that the beginning is only from God, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what for going forward, is from our ſelues and free will.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that Chriſt and ſaluation, is the greateſt fauour which God can beſtowe vpon vs, if we regard the party giuing, the thing giuen, the parties to whom, and the fruit there with.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, that ſo we muſt iudge of theſe fauours, that we know they muſt be with the meanes of preaching and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe vertue and efficacy. They cannot be alone.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, that ſeeing theſe are only of fauour, we had need take heed leaſt we diſpleaſe not God, that he take this grace from vs.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the kind of the thing, the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or tendring of it followeth, in that it is ſaid to be <hi>brought,</hi> ſo is it ſaid els where in the ſcripture, Act: 13, 26, to you is the word of this ſaluation ſent. Chriſt is he whom the father hath ſent, Ioh, 3, 17. Chriſt came among his owne.</p>
            <p>And indeed Chriſt only did not thus but it was neceſſarie, if he meant his people ſhould be ſaued, that he ſhould ſo doe. For neither, 1 did his people ſeeke, 2 neither could they, being dead in ſin ſeeke, 3 and it was impoſſible that grace ſhould come of it ſelfe. For afterward when once Gods people is conuerted, then they ſeeke, not before.</p>
            <p>The bringing heere ſpoken of was only by God.</p>
            <p>That which was brought, was in ſome part receaued.</p>
            <p>Marke then 1 that grace commeth not by chance.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Not of it ſelfe, 3 a man cannot ſeeke for it but by eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grace.</p>
            <p n="4">4 God only can giue it what ſoeuer the meanes are.</p>
            <p n="5">5 God offering, we muſt not be ſo vnmannerly as to
<pb facs="tcp:1866:215"/>refuſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6 And if God tender grace vnto vs, why ſhould not we, one to another.</p>
            <p>This may ſuffice likewiſe for the communicating or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, the further ſetting out heereof followeth, and firſt from the parties to whom it was brought, and they are thoſe to whom this Epiſtle was wrote, to wit, Iewes,</p>
            <p n="1">1 To whom by way of inheritance the promiſes of God might ſeeme to belong, not onely for earthly, but alſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things, as beeing ſomtime the onely people of God. 2 Among whom no doubt, the old Teſtament was often read and expounded, and as it might ſeeme, thinges of Chriſt knowne.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Beſides, they were ſcattered farre and wide from Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and theyr owne country. 4 And taſted no doubt of ſundry croſſes: and yet theſe both haue neede of this grace, and it is brought vnto them. Learne therefore, that,</p>
            <p n="1">1 All outward prerogatiues of viſible Church, of repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to be the people of God, or any ſuch thing, without ſpeciall grace brought, are nothing to ſaluation.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Euen ſome competent, and tolerable meanes, vnleſſe God graciouſly bleſſe, are little or nothing.</p>
            <p n="3">3 No calamities whatſoeuer, if God pleaſe to ſhew fauor ſhall hinder vs from it, no though we were caſt into the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt coaſts of the world, &amp; had all afflictions in the world, as of Iob, or Lazarus, or whoſoeuer.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Nay, grace comming to vs in this eſtate, ſhall vphold vs, teach vs to beare all, and make them ſweet, and fruitfull to vs.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the ſpeciall manner how: <hi>By the reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ieſus Christ.</hi> That is, as was ſhewed before, by Ieſus Chriſt reuealing. In which ſence, God (that is the Father) is likewiſe ſaid to reueale. Gala, 1, 15, 16. The Spirit alſo, 2, Cor, 3, 16, 17, and Chriſt himſelfe called a light, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation of the Gentiles. Luke 2, 32. But moſt cleerly Paule ſpeaketh, Gala, 1, 12. that hee receiued the Goſpell not by man, neither was taught it, but by the reuelation of Ieſus
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1866:215"/>Chriſt, that is, Chriſt Ieſus reuealing, as wee are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it heere.</p>
            <p>And in this ſpeciall manner, wee are to conſider the name and nature of this matter, with the enlarging of it.</p>
            <p>The name and nature is, that it is <hi>reuelation,</hi> the enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, <hi>of Ieſus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reuelation,</hi> is of a Latine word, and ſignifieth as much as vncombering, or taking away that which hindereth the ſight, as a curtaine, ſcarffe, or maske, or any ſuch thing. So that heere it is a borrowed kind of ſpeech, from thinges in ſome ſuch ſort couered.</p>
            <p>Peter in writing this, might thinke of the ſundry coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in the Tabernacle and Temple, and of the veile there, or of that which couered Moſes face, Exod, 34, in the end, whereof Paule writeth, 2, Cor, 3.15.</p>
            <p>Howſoeuer, certaine it is, that things before Chriſt, were not ſo reuealed or vncouered, as afterward.</p>
            <p>The Leuiticall miniſtery was moſt in ſhewes &amp; ſhadows, ſome of the auncient Fathers haue a pretty reſemblance to ſet this out.</p>
            <p>When Thamar ſhould be deliuered, Gene, 39, ſhee had twinnes, &amp; the elder firſt put out his hand, afterward drew it in againe, then was his younger brother borne, then the elder: ſo ſay they, there was a little ſhew of Chriſt, and the New-teſtament, as the putting out of a finger or hand, but preſently it was hid, then preuailed a great while the Iewiſh politie, in the end though followed Chriſt fully exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe, from hence wee muſt know, 1 that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer theſe things heeretofore were hid, yet for ſubſtance they alwaies were in the Church, for indeed God neuer left the Church without meanes of ſaluation, immediatly from the fall and afterward: darkly I confeſſe, yet truly, none muſt denie. Wherefore, while this world laſteth, men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing may be ſaued.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Indeede it is true, things before had many couerings, yet the godly and choſen of God, pearced thorough them all,
<pb facs="tcp:1866:216"/>that hindered not theyr ſaluation. So ſhould we, neuer by the hardneſſe, or hidneſſe of things, be diſcouraged from ſeeking, till we find, and euen ſaluation.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Since now things are cleerer, if wee haue not a greater meaſure of ſauing grace, our fault is the greater.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Nay ſurely, things are ſo euident, that if wee be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, wee can alledge nothing but we may iuſtle ſo be.</p>
            <p>Hetherto the name, and nature, now followeth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging of it, it is the reuelation of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ieſus,</hi> is a broken Hebrew word, and ſignifieth as much as Sauiour, and is the name of the ſonne of God, and the virgin Mary, implying the vertue and effect of his office, to whomſoeuer he is thoroughly reuealed, for indeed hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly faueth them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christ,</hi> is Greeke, and ſignifieth annointed, that is, fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the holy Ghoſt, to be the Prophet to teach the Church. The Prieſt to make reconciliation to bring into the fauour of God, and interceſſion to keepe in his fauour. The King continually to rule, and is that which in Hebrew Meſſias is. So as that wee might read it thus, of <hi>Ieſus the Meſſias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe names ſhew two things, 1 that Ieſus reuealeth: 2 that he reuealeth himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Hee reuealeth himſelfe, as the Authour of this reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to the woman, Iohn 7. To Paule, Acts, 9, 3, 4, 5. To the Diſciples going to Emaus. To Paule, Gala, 1, 12.</p>
            <p>This he doth by himſelfe, 1 perſonally, as in the former, miniſterially by others, as to the Eunuch by Philip, to Cornelius by Peter, to Paule by Ananias.</p>
            <p>I take it, this latter way is chiefly meant heere, though the other may be true.</p>
            <p>And Chriſt is ſaid to reueale this, 1 for that hee himſelfe began firſt to reueale: 2 for that hee ſendeth other reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. 3 And he it is who bleſſeth all reuealing.</p>
            <p>Muſt not then this thing, which ſo great a perſonage by himſelfe, and others, taketh care to reueale, be of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance?</p>
            <pb n="151" facs="tcp:1866:216"/>
            <p> It was moſt neceſſary he onely ſhould reueale, as beeing able, and beeing of credit.</p>
            <p>Or can a man not make much of Reuealers, ſince they come from Chriſt. Pharao honoured Ioſeph greatly for leſſe reuelations. Gene, 41, 45.</p>
            <p>He reuealeth himſelfe as the chiefeſt fauour. Any thing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him is excellent, himſelfe aboue all, in him are all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him all things are nothing.</p>
            <p>Forget not then, that Chriſt is the pith and ſubſtance of all the Bible.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And that we can neuer heere to much and to often of him.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Neither can we know him, but by himſelfe, light maketh me ſee light.</p>
            <p n="4">4 When he is reuealed, you haue the greateſt fauour in the world, God in great loue let Moſes ſee Canaan a far of, one day of the ſonne of man a great good, how much then his whole ſelfe?</p>
            <p>Hetherto hath beene that where-about endeauour is to be beſtowed, now followeth the endeauour it ſelfe. <hi>Truſt perfectly on the grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The which we may conſider, as it is in it ſelfe, truſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and as it is applied to the thing, for ſo muſt the truſt be, as that it be vpon the grace.</p>
            <p>The endeauour in it ſelfe hath two things. The vertue or affection of truſting, and the qualitie of it, perfectly.</p>
            <p>The word which is tranſlated <hi>truſt,</hi> is in the Greeke hope. Thus hope perfectly.</p>
            <p>To hope, is taken in ſcripture two wayes, properly, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what vnproperly. Properly, it ſignifieth to looke for a thing to come, which yet one hath not, as was ſhewed before.</p>
            <p>Vnproperly, it ſignifieth to beleeue or truſt. As in this place, ſo is it taken, Math: 12, 21. Philip, 2, 91, 1. Tim: 4, 10, and, 5, 5.1, Pet: 3, 5. Where howſoeuer in Engliſh it be read truſt, the word in Greeke is hope. Which the learned haue thought good to Engliſh truſt. And not without iuſt cauſe: for ſuch conſanguinitie is there betweene faith and
<pb facs="tcp:1866:217"/>hope, as that often the one is taken for the other. They are like the blood and ſpirits in the body, neuer a ſunder: like the two cherubims, alwayes the one looking vpon the other: indeed to ſpeake as it is, hope is a fruite of faith, but for the like nature and vſe of both they are confounded, our Engliſh word of truſt will fit either hope or beliefe.</p>
            <p>Well then doe we reade it <hi>truſt:</hi> which is the action or practiſe of faith. Which before we well can vnderſtand, we muſt learne to know what faith is: that may we doe by a ſhort ſetting out of the nature of faith, and ſome other truthes tending thereto.</p>
            <p>Faith is a gift of God, wrought by the holy Ghoſt in the hart of a partie regenerate, whereby hee or ſhee taketh knowledge of the doctrine of ſaluation, is perſwaded it is true, and that it belongeth to him or herſelfe, and wholely relieth there-upon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that it is a gift, appeareth, Eph: 2, 8, not of nature, for all haue it not.</p>
            <p>Neither is it a common or baſe gift, but moſt excellent: better then gold: as before in this chapter.</p>
            <p>It is from God, for ſo is euery good and perfect gift, I am: 1, 17, and ſo of God, as from the whole Trinitie: from the father.</p>
            <p>From Chriſt, for ſo the Apoſtles prayed to him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their faith: and the man in Marke, 9, 14, <hi>Helpe my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore is it not an eaſie matter to haue it wrought in vs.</p>
            <p>The holy Ghoſt worketh it.</p>
            <p>Not without the other perſons as before, but rather to implie the other two perſons from the which the holy Ghoſt proceedeth.</p>
            <p>But it is aſcribed to the holy Ghoſt, to ſhew that no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nor all together, can worke it.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit worketh it powerfully, though ſecretly, no man can perceiue how. Ioh: 3, 8.</p>
            <p>And not without meanes of the word and Sacraments.</p>
            <pb n="152" facs="tcp:1866:217"/>
            <p> No partie hath faith but the regenerate, ſo Ioh: 1, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>And yet not to euery regenerate, but ſuch as are of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and haue knowledge, without the which no faith can be.</p>
            <p>Beſides, this faith is in hart, that is, the ſoule, to wit, the minde &amp; will: ſo is it Rom: 10, 9, and Act, 8, 37.</p>
            <p>This draweth all others parts and powers after.</p>
            <p>That which faith regardeth is truth to ſaluation, this truth is the word of God. To wit, the body of Canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as far as it is reuealed vnto vs, and more particularlie, that truth which is concerning Chriſt.</p>
            <p>For as men make much of ſome Iewell, yet is it eſpecially for ſome workmanſhip or ſtone in it, ſo doe all beleeuers like of all truth diuine, but eſpecially of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Beyond all this, faith taketh knowledge of the doctrine of ſaluation. I meane not ſuch knowledge as the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſpeake of, by cauſes without all ignorance, which is able ſubtillie to diſpute and diſſolue all doubtes, but that which hath for all that light and vnderſtanding.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that knowledge is often in ſcripture for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.</p>
            <p>This knowledge we ſpeake of, is firſt notice that there is a truth to be beleeued.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it alwayes hath ſome ground of ſcripture.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it vnderſtandeth the meaning of that ground.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it can diſtinguiſh betweene truth and falſhood.</p>
            <p>Againe, faith is perſwaded that, that which it beleeueth is true. Hence is it called the ground of things hoped for, Heb: 11, 1.</p>
            <p>So as that by the euidence, men can not doe but as that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth. Act, 4, 20. Nay Paule could be contented in aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof to die: ſo did they Heb: 11, 37, 38.39.</p>
            <p>So will the Saints of God alwayes doe, die rather then denie the truth of God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, faith applieth all ſauing truth vnto it ſelfe; that is, that which it knoweth in generall, it is perſwaded is true in ſpeciall, and in the partie where faith is. So Thomas called
<pb facs="tcp:1866:218"/>Chriſt my <hi>Lord my God,</hi> Paule ſaith Chriſt loued him, and haue himſelfe for him. So Dauid, my God my God, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This application is the opening of the hart to attend vnto the truth, Act: 16, 14.</p>
            <p>When the mind iudgeth all to be true in it ſelfe, and the will maketh much of them in it ſelfe, wiſely; therefore was the Creed ſo framed, as that euery one muſt profeſſe, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</hi> Abraham particularly beleeued, ſo ſaith Saint Paule is euery man iuſtified. Rom: 4.</p>
            <p>Chriſt compareth himſelfe to bread, Ioh: 6, ſo as if he be not applied, he is not ours.</p>
            <p>This made the word vnprofitable to the ancient Iewes, becauſe it was not imped with faith, Heb: 4, 2, that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. Beſides, how commeth that neere coniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Chriſt and vs, he to be the head, we the members, he the ſtocke, we the branches, he the foundation, we the building, not by application? true it is, God taketh hold of vs, ſo doe we of God, that it is hand in hand.</p>
            <p>So as nothing can ſeparate, Rom: 8, 38, Iob, and others.</p>
            <p>Of, or to this application, there be ſome ſpeciall workes of the ſoule neceſſarie.</p>
            <p>The firſt is approbation of that which we applie, for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we like it, we will not apprehend it, like it we doe when we iudge our ſelues happie if we could get it, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed while we want it, looke Philip: 3, 8, 9, 10, verſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is expetition or deſire thereof. To this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth the hungering and thriſting mentioned in the ſcriptures. Zacheus climed into a tree but to ſee Chriſt with his eyes.</p>
            <p>The third is apprehenſion, whereby ſo ſoone as grace approcheth, we lay hold of it preſently, not letting it goe as the lame held Peter and Ioh: Act, 3, 11, and the Canaani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh women, would not giue ouer Chriſt in the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>The fourth, is oblectation or delight, whereby we make this grace apprehended our cheefe treaſure, comforting our ſelues therein more then in all other.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, faith relieth it ſelfe vpon all ſauing doctrine.</p>
            <pb n="153" facs="tcp:1866:218"/>
            <p> Thus much for the ſetting out the nature of faith: ſome other things may ſerue alſo heereunto. And firſt we muſt know that,</p>
            <p>Though ſundrie times faith and feeling goe together, yet are they ſeuerall in nature, feeling is a fruit of faith. But is not alwayes with faith.</p>
            <p>Feeling I call a manifeſt worke vpon the affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wherby one hath experience in himſelf of that which he beleeueth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a man may haue faith though he doe not know that he hath it, as a ſleeping man life, and a drunken man reaſon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, all haue not faith in the ſame meaſure, ſome more, ſome leſſe, the leaſt is faith.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the greateſt faith in any of the Saints, hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times beene ſhaken, as in Abraham, Paule, Dauid.</p>
            <p>Which God of purpoſe doth, to make vs wholely hang vpon him, that we ſhould not be ſecure, but haue exerciſe of our giftes.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, in the greateſt ſhaking of fayth, it is faith for all that, that doth vphold, and perceiueth the want of faith, as a party hauing a light on his head, and forgetting where it is, ſeeketh the light by the light. Or as in an ecclipſe, the light remaining in the Moone, bewrayeth the light ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed.</p>
            <p>So is it in one who hath dimme ſight, hee perceiueth by the dimme ſight he hath, that he cannot ſee cleerly.</p>
            <p>By all this, wee may ſomewhat ſee what faith is, now the Apoſtle requireth the practiſe heereof.</p>
            <p>Some learned men thinke, that fayth once giuen, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies continueth in preſence, though not practiſe. But I thinke it continueth in both, ſo as that it is not onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but alwaies working: cloſely I confeſſe as life in ſleep, or Apoplexie, or ſome ſuch. For Paule ſaith, that fayth is one of thoſe gifts which doe continue. 1, Cor, 13, 13.</p>
            <p>Beſides all the former, the Apoſtle ſpeaking in generall, <hi>trust yee,</hi> meaneth that euery one ſhould for theyr parts ſo doe, as at the table, thoſe onely are refreſhed who take to
<pb facs="tcp:1866:219"/>themſelues.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, no time beeing limitted, it noteth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, ſo as if we deferre, we hurt our ſelues.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the vertue or action, now followeth the quality, <hi>perfectly,</hi> perfectly commeth of perfect.</p>
            <p>Perfect is that which hath all it ſhould haue, or vvhich wanteth nothing.</p>
            <p>It is taken two waies,
<list>
                  <item>accurately.</item>
                  <item>tolerably.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Accurate, is when euery thing is ſo abſolute that no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception can be taken, ſo onely is GOD perfect, and his workes in theyr kinde. This perfection is not heer meant.</p>
            <p>Tolerable perfection, is that which it pleaſeth GOD to accept of for Chriſt, though there be ſome blemiſh. This perfection hath,</p>
            <p>Firſt truth, ſo as perfect faith muſt be true, in the witnes of our owne hart, and the preſence of God. Simon Magus and other hypocrites could counterfeit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, fulneſſe, fulneſſe is in two things,
<list>
                  <item>number.</item>
                  <item>degree.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Fulneſſe for number, is when the parts of fayth are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which are three, whereof was ſpoken before. And this fulneſſe is meant heere.</p>
            <p>Fulneſſe in degree, is when euery part is in the greateſt meaſure, which we muſt rather endeuour vnto, then ſhall attaine in this life.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſtancie.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the endeuour it ſelfe, now followeth the application thereof, <hi>trust on the grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Generall truſt, without application to grace in Chriſt, is not ſufficient.</p>
            <p>Many haue as they ſay, a good hope and truſt, but not knowing why, or wherein, they were as good not to truſt, as to truſt to nothing.</p>
            <p>Nay, truſting to God himſelfe, vnleſſe by Chriſt, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1866:219"/>no comfort. Neither without grace can a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the leaſt hope of any good.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſeeing that wee muſt truſt vpon grace, as wee haue heard before particularly, it appeareth: That one may know his particuler beeing in grace. Elſe would not Chriſt bid his reioyce that theyr names were written in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens.</p>
            <p>The which Paule ſheweth to be generall to all iuſtified by faith, to haue peace with God, &amp; ioy in the holy Ghoſt, wherein is the kingdome of God, whereto in this life wee enter.</p>
            <p>Why ſhould Paule bid vs prooue our ſelues, whether we be in the faith, if wee might not, and ſhould not endeuour to find our ſelues therein?</p>
            <p>Now this muſt be vnderſtood, 1 of ſuch as are called: for till one be ſo, hee cannot know himſelfe: ſo as that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and ſuch as haue not the vſe of ſanctified reaſon, muſt heere be excepted.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Againe, one may be vnder a tentation, and exerciſe of conſcience, wherby at the inſtant he ſhall be vnfit to iudge of the former.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Beginning grace is not ſo eaſily perceiued as growne grace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that ſeeing we muſt truſt to grace, it cannot be but ſufficient. Gods grace is as great as himſelfe, by the which beeing iuſtified, we haue all with it. Thus God aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Paule, 2, Cor, 1, 29, in caſe of reſiſting temptations, that his grace was ſufficient, as Paule did find it to be. So as that we muſt ioyne no other thing for our repoſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that grace is moſt certaine, it is as conſtant as God himſelfe, reſting vpon his nature, his promiſe, ſo as that truſting thereto, we neuer ſhall or can be deceiued.</p>
            <p>Hetherto hath been the doctrine, the vſe followeth, and that manifold.</p>
            <p>Firſt to conſider, that ſeeing the Apoſtle requireth faith, it is not a common, or thing that is euery where, then nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no exhortation to be made for the promiſe of it. Nay
<pb facs="tcp:1866:220"/>Chriſt himſelfe findeth want of faith euen in Iſraell, Math, 8, 10. In ſo much as he is faine to ſay to his owne Diſciples, Luke 8, 25. Where is your faith? And elſwhere, Luke 17, 6, noteth that they had not ſo much faith as was a graine of Muſtard-ſeede in bigneſſe.</p>
            <p>Neyther was this onely at that time when himſelfe liued in the world, but he ſheweth it will be a hard thing to finde fayth vppon the earth when the ſonne of man commeth. Luke 18, 8.</p>
            <p>And how can it be otherwiſe, but charitie waxing colde, Math, 24, 12. but iniquity muſt abound? and that from the dried roote of faith? whence charitie cannot ſpring.</p>
            <p>Beſides, ſo many are the things that ſet againſt fayth, as that if it were poſſible, the very elect would be ouercome.</p>
            <p>All this, as it is true in generall, ſo may euery one finde it by experience in himſelfe. How doth a ſmall ſinne quell fayth? much more then, the greater and viler.</p>
            <p>So as that wee had all neede to remember Paules charge, 2, Cor, 13, 5, to trie our ſelues whether we are in the faith, or faith in vs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Peter wiſhing vs to truſt perfectly, and giueth vs to know that there is iuſt cauſe, why we ſhould ſo doe, Gods commandement were ſufficient, Mar: 11, 22, Haue faith in God. And Ioh: 14, 1, You beleeue in God (that is, the father) beleeue in me, the ſonne Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But beſides, this that we ſhould beleeue is the end, for the which ſcriptures were penned, Ioh: 20, 31.</p>
            <p>Why ſermons are preached.</p>
            <p>For confirmation whereof, Sacraments were ordained, and are to be vſed.</p>
            <p>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, Heb: 11, 6 and what ſoeuer is not of faith is ſin, Rom: 14, 23.</p>
            <p>Faith is the ſalt of the ſoule keeping it from corruption.</p>
            <p>It enableth vs to doe things pleaſing to God, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it is their no ſanctification.</p>
            <p>It maketh all your deedes done by it to pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>It embracing Chriſt, hath with him all things, and firſt
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1866:220"/>the fauour of God.</p>
            <p>Gods fauour bringeth with it, 1 reconciliation, whereby God and wee are made friends, we haue our ſinnes forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, Chriſts righteouſneſſe counted vnto vs, peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ioy in the holy Ghoſt: boldneſſe to make prayers with truſt to be heard, recouery of right to the creatures, ſo as that in good conſcience, with prayer and thankes giue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we may vſe them, where as otherwiſe before God we are but as vſurpers.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Perfection and defence whereby God keepeth vs ſafe and ſound.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Gouernment, when Gods word and ſpirit continually ruleth vs.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That all things ſhall worke together for our good, afflictions, infirmities, ſcandals, whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>Now, as our life without theſe cannot be but moſt wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, ſo with them is it moſt bleſſed, ſo as faith which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all theſe by getting of Chriſt only, is diligently to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it ſhalbe profitable to know what meanes were the meeteſt to vſe for attaining of faith.</p>
            <p>True it is that God only giueth and worketh it, but not without ſome other things, which in ſo great a matter as faith is, had not neede either to be ſmall, or few; ſeeing no excellent thing, is otherwiſe wrought.</p>
            <p>And heere we ſpeake not of the firſt ſeede of faith, for that God alone giueth without any worke of ours, but of the groweth and increaſe thereof, which though God giue it is not while we are idle.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It ſhall be good to marke when any ſenſible motion of Gods Spirit, ſtirreth our harts to hearken to the Word to beleeue it, in the commaundements and promiſes of it, and in no caſe to defer to doe thereafter at the inſtant, ſo is it Reuel: 3, 20, Behold, I ſtand at the doore and knocke, if any man heare my voice, and open the doore, I will come in, els not.</p>
            <p>In no caſe muſt ſuch opportunities be forſlowed, nor the
<pb facs="tcp:1866:221"/>Spirit quenched, 1, Theſſa: 5, 19, but all deligence muſt be vſed, for that theſe motions or ſtirrings are not, 1 continuall.</p>
            <p n="2">2 They are not alwayes very ſenſible and apparent, and if we marke not well, we may miſſe of them though they knocke, they are like the firſt ſtirrings of the infant in the wombe, faint and weake.</p>
            <p n="3">3 A little thing will ouercome them.</p>
            <p>Theſe are many times ioyned with the ſight and feeling of our ſinnes, which being directed by Gods ſpirit, will turne vs to Chriſt, ſo as alwayes any feeling of ſin ſhould driue vs to ſeeke to Chriſt by faith.</p>
            <p>Thus can we neuer ſeeke but by inſtance of prayer.</p>
            <p n="2">2 After this, be alwayes about the word of God, which is the word of faith, where Gods free promiſes muſt cheefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be looked vnto.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Then Gods fauours heertofore beſtowed vpon vs, muſt alwayes be renewed, where if we find any of ſaluation, let vs know, that in all others God will be like vnto himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Neuer giue ouer for ſome doubtings of faith. But be ſtriuing againſt them.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Thanke God for the faith you haue. Thanked-for grace, will increaſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in that we are wiſhed to truſt, and no meaſure of faith is ſet downe, neuer ſhould we be diſcouraged though our faith be neuer ſo ſmall, if it be true, for Chriſt doth not quench the ſmoking flaxe, nor breake the bruſed reede.</p>
            <p>Faith is little, 1 when one hath no feeling of it in himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 When he is toſſed much with doubtings.</p>
            <p n="3">3 When many ſlipes fall out, and in the ſame kind.</p>
            <p>And yet this faith neuer ſo weake is true, 1 If it neuer giue ouer nor yeeld to any aſſaults.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If it endeauour to increaſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3 If for the meaſure it be working, and leaue not the party idle: working, is endeauour in the duties of godlineſſe and priuate calling.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, euery one is to try his faith.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1866:221" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> True faith is wrought by the Word: counterfeit other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>True faith ſeeth the miſery of the partie by reaſon of ſin where it is: counterfeit faith neuer feeleth ſinne to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>True faith appeareth in afflictions, to make vs waite vpon God, to be patient, to comfort our ſelues in God in tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to reſiſt them.</p>
            <p>In proſperitie, that we ſtill cleaue to God.</p>
            <p>True faith, knoweth the worth of it ſelfe, and appriſeth it ſelfe aboue all other things.</p>
            <p>It deſireth to increaſe and continue.</p>
            <p>It would bring others to it.</p>
            <p>It is the better by any thing that doth befall it.</p>
